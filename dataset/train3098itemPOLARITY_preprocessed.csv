1;negative;PROPN, what you are trying to do is a terrible idea! If you ever find yourself having to engineer something as fundamental as that, take a step back and work out what else does it! I do n't really believe in the whole spoon fed SO thing, but what mtwebster says is on the right track!
2;positive;' Course I do, corrected.
3;positive;Excellent, happy to help! If you do n't mind, can you accept my answer?
4;negative;@talnicolas I 'm using it a few dozen times in my class. It 's heavy to write, not easy to read and very painful to debug. I 'm sorry, I did n't think the question was that subjective, maybe someone should move it to PROGRAMMERS
5;neutral;I did n't select an answer because even though two of them helped neither of them is complete.
6;neutral;This is for Tomcat 5.5
7;neutral;PROPN PROPN," PROPN. Confusion is bliss", so ... Do all` PROPN PROPN` have the same state? If so then have a single` PROPN` that every` Item` references.[` Application. Properties`](   may be a way to globally communicate visualness.
8;positive;Excellent! Thank you for your perseverence :)
9;positive;Wow, I 've just had a look at the PROPN PROPN. It looks excellent! A really intuitive way to build apps. Thanks for the tip!
10;neutral;A few but they all seem proprietary.
11;negative;To push it to PROPN, you 'll have to add it to your repo. Why do n't you want to commit it? It 's recommended to commit PROPN in your repo( unless you 're developing a gem ): When developing an app, check in your Gemfile.lock, since you will use the bundler tool across all machines, and the precision enforced by bundler is extremely desirable for applications.
12;positive;PROPN PROPN rn PROPN PROPN that 's really great!
13;neutral;I 'm not sure if this is a case here but if you are really worried about the PROPN in this case and you 'd like to better control behavior of your derived maps and thus their influence on the performance of the PROPN in my opinion you should take a look at the usage of different kind of references( strong, weak, soft, phantom) in PROPN. Also remember that pre- optimization is a root of all evil especially in programming.
14;negative;I do n't see how this is possible, but I really, really hate to run my query an extra time just to get the record count so I can build a pager. When I say a" pager" I simply mean the common gizmo with a link for each 10 records for example.
15;neutral;Have added an answer
16;negative;Yes, but it 's tricky, since datetime parsing in PROPN is a pain in the neck.
17;negative;PROPN: to me, it does not matter what they advise if they do not provide alternatives. I have been a happy user of qthttp thus far without worries, but yes, it is just a quick workaround as written.
18;negative;@MaximilianB_ther I 'm sorry to hear that ... Maybe you can get in touch with the developers of PROPN and ask them to help you out? If not, I 'm afraid I can not help you much more! Regards, PROPN
19;neutral;This question would now be more appropriate on PROPN.
20;negative;After looking at the answers below, I am very sad that this is an example of backwards progress for PROPN.
21;negative;I installed PROPN 2009 PROPN 4 yesterday( very painful process) Now, How can I make sure if it is properly updated? What is the build number shown in the PROPN about box?
22;negative;I 'm very sorry about my horrible PROPN! only for this example I use radio button, I 'm considering using textbox too
23;neutral;I assume you 're using PROPN PROPN 's excellent requests library to do the PROPN requests( if not, you really should PROPN likely, the problem is that requests does n't add a' Content- type' header to multi- part uploads, and packmgr does n't read multi- part bodies with no' Content- type' header. So, while a normal' requests' POST of a multipart- encoded file would go something like this: you instead have to use the longer form, setting an explicit content- type: Note that one side- effect of doing it this way is that it can not stream the file- the entire package ZIP file will be read into memory.
24;negative;Not for me, but I can suggest some possibilities: It may cause problem while editing--> This can be solved by using some comments--> And then this will cause the code messier Some code may crash and your code success will go away from you |.|--> No solution- unless you know more about the code! Code upgrade problem-- If external code has upgrade you may have problem to know which is that PROPN> Again use comments--> And again messier So these are some that I can think PROPN --- Some cons: You can make it more convenient to edit--> You can edit more than one code at onceYou can edit some code that you wan't able to edit( external resource before)--> Modifying is more convenient. You can make it load faster--> 1 file with 1000 PROPN is faster than 1000 files with 1 PROPN each. It is safer--> You do n't need to worry about external resource being deleted!!These are my suggestions. Try to think more about it!
25;negative;I have just finish that site, but there is a silly bug that remain ... if you check PROPN horizontal position of the PROPN page there is a slight shift ... nothing to cry about but WHY here is the 2 pages any idea, the horizontal css is: i do nt like my page to do the PROPN- cha- cha!
26;neutral;So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one. I think the example below solved the problem( or at least gives an idea of how to solve it ): The extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped.
27;negative;Lastly, I do n't see any styling data. Does your project have some CSS defined somewhere?
28;negative;I 'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly: do you know why? I guess it has to do with escaping, but what and where?
29;positive;Here 's a secret. In the chrome dev tools, do a cpu profile run. After you have stopped capturing, at the bottom of the screen is a down triangle next to" Heavy( PROPN PROPN)". Click the triangle and select" PROPN PROPN". Once you are in PROPN PROPN mode, you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles, how long they take, and exactly what functions are being called. The PROPN PROPN is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues, ng- repeat performance problems, digest cycle problems! I really do n't know how I was able to debug and profile before the PROPN PROPN. Here is an example:
30;negative;And what do those" lines upon lines of errors" say?( PROPN! Getting information out of you is about as painful as pulling out teeth!!)
31;neutral;The function signature for pthread_create requires a function that returns. Also, returned from should be treated opaquely. Both of these changes are reflected below and compile on my machine: UPDATE: There are some other issues with your program as well. For example, it 's very likely that main will exit before your thread runs. You should join on your thread if you want to make sure it exits first. Using raw pthreads is a great way to learn about threads but can be very very painful compared to some of the pre- existing frameworks out there- try boost::thread or std::thread if you want to just get up and running with as little hassle as possible.
32;positive;Excellent! Thanks for the info.
33;negative;this is for facial recognition, and auto submitting username and passwords in your browser, if you are in front of your PC. nothing malicious bout that?
34;negative;Here is my PROPN code .. .. I 'm extremely crappy with my PROPN code, could someone help me convert this? I basically want to convert a variable such as" marine- heavy" to" PROPN( heavy)".
35;neutral;No, the output is not the same; one is a PROPN value, the other an undecoded bytes value. For ASCII, that looks the same, but when you load any web page that uses characters outside the ASCII characterset, the difference will be much clearer. Take PROPN encoded data, for example: That 's a simple PROPN PROPN DASH character. The bytes representation shows the 3 bytes PROPN uses to encode the codepoint. You really want to read up on PROPN vs. encoded data here, I recommend: The PROPN PROPN Every PROPN PROPN Absolutely, Positively Must Know About PROPN and PROPN PROPN( PROPN PROPN!) by PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN by PROPN PROPN
36;positive;Wow, great! thanks, I did n't know this one existed.
37;negative;Suppose I have this interface And this class Is there a way, or is there a tool that can let me automatically put in the comments of each member in a base class or interface? Because I hate re- writing the same comments for each derived sub- class!
38;negative;I asked before about pixel- pushing, and have now managed to get far enough to get noise to show up on the screen. Here 's how I init: Here 's how I render each frame: Problem is this is awfully awfully slow, around 5fps. I think my path to publish the buffer must be wrong. Is it even possible to do full- screen pixel- based graphics that I could update at 30fps, without using the 3D chip?
39;positive;PROPN, if you submit that as a separate response I 'll make you the winner!
40;negative;Now when I load it to the device, an image wo n't show up. This is all kinds of horrible!
41;negative;It 's very painful to add multiple tickets to PROPN or to have it as your own todo list. That causes people to use their own task management tools so tasks are then spread all around. Is there any plugin or macro that would quicken the process of adding a ticket?
42;positive;Excellent! Look forward to hearing from you.
43;neutral;Okay, I see your confusion and edited my response with some sample code/ an appropriate link to wikipedia. You are confusing the entropy of the model 's probability distribution with the cross PROPN( or likelihood) of the predictions it makes on real data. Consider a model that assigns probability 1 to some event and probability 0 to everything else. It has 0 entropy, but makes absolutely terrible predictions on any testing distribution that is n't a purely non- random sequence, assigning 0 probability to events that actually happen.
44;negative;Was afraid someone would say that ...! Is there any hack I could put in place?
45;positive;Excellent questions! This particular project will need PROPN, PROPN, etc.
46;negative;That 's really bad. PROPN looks extremely ugly with PROPN default!
47;positive;Excellent point! :)
48;neutral;When you try it, you get the error: This comes from( line 3023 on my sources, but varies by version), in. The comment there explains that: This routine is to be called by statements that must not run inside a transaction block, typically because they have non- rollback- able side effects or do internal commits. For it 's called from in under the case for, but unfortunately there is n't any informative comment that says why specifically is n't safe to run in a transaction. Looking at the sources, I can see that for one thing it forces a checkpoint. Overall, though, I do n't see anything that really screams out" we ca n't do this transactionally". It 's more" we have n't implemented the functionality to do this transactionally".
49;neutral;@KubaOber, I was in the process of revising the answer, but see you 've already answered it.
50;positive;Let 's imagine something like this: Later I can do something like this: Is there any way I can set the limit when using the named query, and not when defining it? I 'd would really love to do something like: or PROPN in advance! :-)
51;neutral;This can probably be done using PROPN.
52;neutral;If I understand your question correctly, the exception is because variable is not found inside the function. I 'd suggest learning scoping rules in PROPN or read this excellent to- the- point chapter on the topic( or search for this topic on the Web!).The other thing I 'd recommend is not to handle all exceptions as you 've shown in your snippet. Here 's why. The fixed code could look something like this:
53;neutral;You 'll need to create or call a refresh function from the same place as the alert() in the .get() call. That function is a success post- back.
54;positive;As I comment your question, there are of problems inside your code so better will be to use some ready function/ class for it :) just search for it .. How ever I can give you easy way to display what you want .. Replace your FOR loop with that code and it will be fine :) But really!!! 1st- PROPN_ functions are deprecated use mysqli or PROPN instead .. 2nd- ESCAPE all variables in your queries .. 3rd- PROPN for using more flexible methods of work( function/ objects ..)
55;neutral;You can download a local copy of PROPN or use a CDN. This link has details:
56;neutral;I think it speaks volumes about PROPN that the PROPN for the arrow keys form an angry sad face:%&'(( works better in the comment text entry font)
57;neutral;I 'm using PROPN 's implementation, namely
58;negative;Okay, a before< example> And a desired after< example> I know, horrific( do n't ask!) See how the slash in the key indicates children, and how the order is nested accordingly? And items without orders are simply shifted to the bottom. But also how multiple' same level' items with the same order are merely sorted by key?
59;neutral;I need the page to include the sitemap because I 'm saving context from each of the three previous pages. That way the user can click the previous page in the sitemap, and it will load the data I stored( i.e. load the data from their previous search).
60;positive;There is another way ... As the PROPN application is coded with the .NET framework, it is compiled to PROPN( PROPN PROPN PROPN). This means you can use a decompiler such as PROPN to decompile and view the code of PROPN. This will give you some idea of how PROPN works so you can implement the same ideas into your own code project ... Hope this helped!Rodit
61;positive;Would you happen to have another column in your table where you can group them as" 1 2 3 4"," 1 2 3 4", PROPN would look something like this:1st column PROPN second PROPN| PROPN| PROPN| PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN| PROPN PROPN PROPN| 2If you order it by 2nd column, it will return 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2. But since you have another column, you can do order by 1st column, 2nd column, and it will be 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2.This ia ofcourse assuming that you have a field like 1st column. But given that you 're looking at having them order like 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4, there must be something in your other fields that can help you achieved that PROPN this helps!
62;positive;You would need to create a counter integer variable that can keep track of the line index for you. Hope it helps!
63;neutral;Yes, this is question.
64;negative;PROPN I execute my app in PROPN mode, the execution breaks inside some class file of an external library that I 'm using. Even though it 's a NullPointerException, for some reason I can hit resume and continue the execution. In case you 're curious, I 've put the stacktrace below. My problem though is that I simply want to stop that. It 's extremely annoying and happens every now and then during the execution. But I ca n't find any setting anywhere which will prevent breaking inside class files. How do I avoid this?
65;negative;I can not seem to figure out why the phpunit target does not output any test results even though I have tests in position. The problem I am finding is there is no indication as to what the problem is! Incredibly frustrating. The output is as follows: My build.xml is as follows: My system: PROPN, PROPN 5.2.9, PROPN 3.4, PHPUnderControl, PROPN
66;positive;excellent alternative!
67;negative;I do n't have any control over the dataset I recieve. The only thing I know is that it contains everything.
68;neutral;Is your test case exhibiting this behavior in PROPN? I have tried it in PROPN, PROPN and PROPN and do not see the shrinking you 're talking about, although PROPN and PROPN force a left- margin indent while dragging.(???)&# PROPN;
69;positive;You 're very welcome! It would be nice though if you upvoted and accepted the answer. This way other users could refer to it if they pass to the same trouble you had= P
70;positive;PROPN, you are correct! transposed them as i was writing.
71;negative;Is this valid? what I 'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time?
72;negative;I 'm afraid you can not fetch PROPN PROPN API do n't provide any API to do so.
73;negative;I store ranges in PROPN PROPN, but a lot of queries to MySQL for getting provider name- it 's terrible :(
74;neutral;Make a canvas path glow by applying a series of overlapping shadows with increasing PROPN PROPN:    can change the styling of the glow by varying the number of overlays and the blur size. Example code for a glow effect: To get the outline path of your phone image, you can use the" marching ants" PROPN. This PROPN will create a path that outlines an image. In your case you would define the image as all pixels that are not transparent. Here 's a very good implementation of" marching ants" that is used in the excellent PROPN library:   used like this: DrawImage your phone on the canvas. Get the pixel color array from the canvas using PROPN PROPN a function that checks the pixel array for non- transparent pixels at any PROPN, PROPN on the canvas. Call the contour function: Here 's an example result: the glow is automatically generated using overlapping shadowsthe outline path of the phone is calculated using the marching ants algorithm
75;positive;It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program 's design more precise. Next thing you can do is to execute a, whic you are going to mark as. After having done this you can use .Here 's how: Be warned that it 's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs, but this option wo n't hurt much if you 're just trying to disable a function. By the way, this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it, it 's now up to you to choose which method will receive this. Hope this was helpful!
76;negative;I want to duplicate a very large table, but I do not want to copy it row by row. Is there a way to duplicate it? For example, you can TRUNCATE w/o deleting row/ row, so i was wondering if there is something similar for copying entire tables UPDATE: row by row PROPN is very painful( because of 120 PROPN rows). Anyway to avoid that?
77;negative;Yeah, I know, I just ca n't figure out where the' private' is coming from. It 's very frustrating!
78;positive;Excellent! PROPN really is an impressive language.
79;positive;If you only need the count( like you express in your original question), you could do: Hope it helps!
80;positive;There are two issues with your regex pattern: Firstly, you forgot to add the PROPN at the beginning. this is why only the last characters were checked, or to say: you did not check the entire input. Secondly, your cyrill check did not seem to be correct. Still, I am not used to cyrillic letters and I should be careful before I judge ;) hope it helps!
81;positive;PROPN, that was going to be my next suggestion! Good luck :)
82;negative;no answer yet .... PROPN PROPN
83;positive;You can use this PROPN this helps!
84;negative;yeaa i m just not sure how i would be able to store a user input string into the array. I 've looked around online and tried out some of their code. So i m not sure. I really hate PROPN. :(
85;positive;that 's great :)
86;neutral;Some of your code seemed redundant, so I removed some. Such as defining and then duplicating it into so I just defined once. I got rid of,, and since you can just as easily enter the value directly. Then I got rid of the whole get the latest file in the log folder, and just added the content to the log file defined earlier. I changed the log entries so they were done by tabs so the entry type, date, and the actual entry all line up nicely when you view the log file. Lastly I changed the whole If> ElseIf> PROPN thing into a PROPN, because PROPN is awesome and totally underused! Oh yeah, I got rid of because it 's pointless to define a variable and then just echo it. What you could do is in the section have it write- host the error and call the log function again, so people are forced to enter a valid entry.
87;negative;@Pekka- what 's the emoticon for being terribly embarrassed!
88;neutral;[ fiddle](   was not related to the table layout of auto versus fixed. The fiddle shows that it works for both. If you are still seeing a problem while using the newer version of PROPN- PROPN, then it must be another issue with your code.
89;negative;I have implemented this in my PROPN PROPN addon PROPN PROPN as PROPN PROPN PROPN. If you type variable followed by a period(.) a list of all possible members of this class is presented in a list from which you can choose: Second option is to move cursor over any class to view it 's members: See details here:  # member- completionP.S. sorry for this self promo- PROPN is very angry for promoting 3rd party software in PROPN questions but there is no support for this in official PROPN PROPN editor and many people ask for this.
90;positive;How do you train PROPN PROPN for pattern recognition? For example a face recognition in a picture how would you define the output neurons?( PROPN. how to detect where is the face exactly, rather than just saying that there is a face in camera). Also, how about detecting multiple faces and different size of faces? If anyone could give me a pointer it would be really great Cheers!
91;positive;the question just came to me from a different team. The question was" how to query the users in the exchange server 's particular PROPN group". Its said that the PROPN server user group is not linked to an Ad group. The examples i could get are all for querying based on AD group. I heard there are two ways either through PROPN or through PROPN. Either solution is fine, but through PROPN will be super awesome! Thanks again!
92;neutral;What will you be doing with the images? Displaying them in the browser?
93;negative;It is really painfull to get all code form PROPN whenever you make a build using NANT. Is there any settings in ccnet.config which will only take the files which are changed form last time which can speed up the process.
94;negative;I 'm not for sure how the PROPN of PROPN works, so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me. I recently discovered the magic that is extension methods and PROPN. Well, I was very sad to find that this is n't valid syntax However from what I can tell, does implement the interface which provides such methods, so what gives? Why does n't that just work? I have found a decent work around for this issue at least:
95;positive;@Bober02 if u are in this industry sooner or later you will" meet" PROPN PROPN 's excellent blog, I 'm glad to introduce you to it. :)    Happy reading!
96;negative;we definitely have differing views on what is the" easier" method achieve this functionality, and dealing with threads is not easier for me
97;positive;Is there a shorthand for a new line character in PROPN? In PROPN( on PROPN) I usually just use" \n", but that does n't seem to work in PROPN- specifically outputs in PROPN,( PROPN) from the command line, and from the PROPN( GREAT PROPN!) works, but is there anything shorter?
98;positive;I have a long scrolling page, and want to test if an element is 100px from the top, then apply a class elsewhere( until the next element in line is 100px from the top) If I could just get the basic statement I would be ecstatic, anything extra would be a bonus!
99;positive;PROPN No worries! Glad to have helped :)
100;positive;Excellent point! Thanks!! I did mean just the left side though ..( I should have specified that). Was glad to learn your insight though ..
101;positive;You can do as followed: When your app is not started/ running and you start from an notification, onCreate gets called. When your app is running( background or foreground), and you start a new intent from an notification this method gets called:( if you are using singleTop) To detect whether your app is running back- or foreground, you can simply set a boolean in PROPN/ onResume: Hope it helps!
102;negative;I just caught that, PROPN does n't preform spell checking on the title field for some reason.
103;positive;is in so u need not to worry!Internally the data is always stored as TEXT, so even if you create table with, PROPN is going to follow the rules of data type
104;negative;I 'm trying to output the following from within a liquid template: Obviously, PROPN sees this as a variable named and tries to do substitution. I 'm trying to find out how I can output the actual braces. So far, I 've found one method that works, but it 's incredibly ugly: Yeah, told you it was gross. Here are other things I 've tried: Any advice here?
105;neutral;Assets are bundled with your PROPN and they are read only. You can not delete them in your app. If you 're really worried about storage usage, consider alternative database distribution mechanisms such as downloading it over the network.
106;negative;exactly why i 'm asking because that s what i fear!
107;positive;<3 <3 <3!!! :)
108;negative;I need to perform the same hash server side. All this code that I am digging through seems to have been run through some compression tool. Devastating.
109;neutral;Just that they make you list the type twice. i.e. List list= new PROPN()
110;negative;I 'm looking for as automatic way as possible. Surronding every query with a PROPN would work, but it 's a lot of work.
111;neutral;You need to make the following changes to your code: However keep in mind that this is extremely vulnerable to PROPN injection, and you should also swap MySQL for PROPN/ PROPN immediately if you plan to use this code on a live website.
112;neutral;I just noticed also that you 're calling** sortable** on the reportTableBody class, but that class does not exist in the fiddle code.
113;positive;I have but instead of bothering them I 'd like to do it myself. I really enjoy trying new things and so far figuring all of this out has been very fun!
114;negative;You are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input. You should either read the entire line( including the newline, perhaps using a) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic. PROPN Converting case by adding or subtracting 32 is a really awful approach. It wo n't work with anything but a- z and PROPN- Z( in the PROPN alphabet). It wo n't work for most characters outside the PROPN PROPN block and should n't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case( such as newline). You should be using and instead.
115;positive;Is there a way to pattern match in PROPN# so that it will check to see if both elements in a two element tuples are equal. I 'm incredibly new to PROPN#, and also new to the whole concept of PROPN PROPN in general. I was thinking something along the lines of ... But I guess that would be too easy hah. Any suggestions? Or is there even a way to do that? Thanks for your help, you guys are incredibly helpful!
116;negative;Unless you are able to demonstrate the problem with displayed code then I 'm afraid there 's not much more I can do to help you out.
117;neutral;Nope. It comes right up.
118;positive;Gosh! you 're right!!! Excellent!!!! Is there a way to expand it programatically? I added .setOngoing(true)( to the top) but it 's not expanded ...( not really the top because the first one is a notification when I 'm plugged to USB for tools developpement). Thank you again my friend!
119;negative;PROPN PROPN: That 's really sad :'( PROPN :'(
120;neutral;The first line sets the file name variables and sets the field separator to comma. The second line sets the output field separator to comma too. The third line prints lines with 3 fields to the new file; the fourth line prints lines with other than 3 fields to the error file. Note that your code would be excruciatingly slow on big files because it executes two processes per line. This code has only one process operating on the whole file which will be really important if the input grow to thousand or millions or more lines.
121;positive;Excellent! Thanks.
122;negative;Sorry, I was just trying to help and obviously misread the question. No need to get angry!
123;positive;Great! Good to hear it. Can you please accept my answer? :)
124;positive;You are right. See my update! Make a suggestion pls and I 'll catch your thoughts ;)
125;negative;I have a function name called setValue, used in many classes. Also, i have a global function by the same name. When i press PROPN], it goes to arbitrary setValue function. How do i directly jump to the global setValue function? It is really pain to use tnext every time to find if the function global.
126;neutral;Also, your fiddle example seems to be cut from a much bigger project with a lot of superfluous code hanging around. I think if you are able to duplicate the issue in fiddle then you should pare down the code to eliminate some of that and make it easier to troubleshoot.
127;neutral;PROPN abuse! Use PROPN: HTML: PROPN should be much faster then PROPN( as with everything PROPN).
128;positive;that 's the hope :)
129;positive;@AlexK. excellent thought. Edited.
130;positive;This works excellent, thank you very much!( Trim('0'||mycolumns))
131;negative;Do n't have access to any other versions here I 'm afraid :(
132;neutral;I was wondering whether anyone knows of any tools available that perform the task of analyzing one or more CSS files, determining the similarity between the various rules within the files and presenting the user with options for the merging and reduction of rulesets. I ask this because a project I am working on has reached the point where it has so much CSS that PROPN PROPN( Still the bottom line I 'm afraid) chokes on the CSS after page load, causing a 3- 5 second lock- up in interactivity until the choke is processed. In case you 're wondering: Yes, I am sure it is the CSS causing this issue.
133;neutral;No problem. I see you got your answer above. Did that satisfy your question or is there anything else?
134;neutral;Added bounty to see if I can get a full answer( ideally: the code snippet that, when added above, answers the question).
135;positive;That 's excellent! Please post it as an answer so I can accept it.
136;negative;To be honest I do n't even know where to start. I guess the solution might entail using a zillion IIf statements. I 'm fairly new to this I 'm afraid!
137;positive;I second trying to put the whole path instead. For relative paths, if you 're doing compiling and running in command line/ terminal, you need to have that studentrecords.txt in the same directory of your code files. If you 're using an PROPN, you need to put your studentrecords.txt under the src/ folder. This is assuming you 're not in PROPN project setup; otherwise it should be put under /src/ main/ java/ resources/ .Hope this helps!
138;positive;You can use PROPN on PROPN code now. I never tried git before but I 'm loving PROPN.
139;negative;whenever i drag- n- drop a stored procedure onto my PROPN canvas, the parameters/ arguments for the stored procedure are all nullable. Why is this? Is it because of how i 've declared my parameters inside the stored procudure itself? Besides manually creating my stored procedure methods in the PROPN partial class( or drag- n- drop onto canvas, cut from PROPN code, move to partial class, then remove nullables types) .. is there any way to fix this? It 's really frustrating :(
140;negative;It 's PROPN! No, seriously, I do n't like it.
141;negative;worried about PROPN compatibility!!
142;negative;The problem is that you never run the method, so the field stays at zero. It 's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name.
143;positive;Excellent! Cheers dude
144;negative;PROPN, how I hate those people who downvote answers without leaving a comment as for why the downvote ...
145;negative;PROPN, the stack trace under that is just my function name. Nothing more. very frustrating :(
146;neutral;Turns out to be a pretty small tweak, you were almost there! You have to re- set the option prior to the if you want to have the new selection box, visually change: Which then successfully redraws the box upon a single click as like it does within the below PROPN, which listens to the dimensions which are set within the object: PROPN PROPN:
147;negative;I should add that the element thing throws an error when it ca n't find something. Do you normally use try/ except for all find_element commands?* oh so very sad* :(
148;neutral;No communications. Just trying to get one to run the other, passing it a few params. They are both installed to the same directory under PROPN PROPN and access files under app data.
149;negative;So, the following hack seems to work, but it 's really incredibly ugly PROPN, as it relies on you controlling the line- height and using absolute positioning. Worse, it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text, which depends on the width of the div and the font- size, and probably requires PROPN to compute. Anyway, after all the above disclaimers, here 's the hack: Use two divs with the same text, one on top of the other. One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one. HTML PROPN PROPN. Of course, the above code is hard- coded for the specific width. Again, you 'll probably need PROPN in order to compute the number of lines in the PROPN. I 'm pretty sure that until this gets implemented in PROPN you probably wo n't find an elegant solution for your problem.
150;positive;Per:   need to be registered as a member of a PROPN PROPN or PROPN PROPN that is designated for Beta or Alpha testing by the Developer. If you are not registered, you will only be able to download the production app from PROPN PROPN, NOT the Beta or PROPN version of the app from PROPN PROPN. Having the" link" wo n't be sufficient, you need to opt- in to the beta or alpha via PROPN PROPN or PROPN PROPN. Please note that even if you properly opt- in via PROPN PROPN or PROPN PROPN as defined by the developer, you will need to wait several hours( perhaps 2- 8 hours) for your status to propagate via PROPN PROPN. So, perhaps you need to wait 2- 8 hours even if your Beta/ Alpha status is PROPN this helps!
151;positive;I 'm building a little script that changes content and css live on the page based upon the values of various input fields. I 'm able to change the content" live" absolutely fine as you 'll see here: I 'm not able to get this working with the css method using the same principles though: Thanks!
152;positive;It would be super great! if you can help me with iframe and cookies stuff ... data.message contains URL
153;neutral;PROPN, a library which is used for parsing XML, is a very good example for the usage of arrows( have a look how often the word occurs in the module names of this package!). You shall have a look on the great tutorial:    it is also good to have the arrow concept for functions. For example the following code just works, because is an instance of the arrow class( The operator is defined in PROPN. Arrow).Thanks to the arrow syntax you have also a great tool to write complex computations in PROPN( it works as well for functions, monads and XML filters in PROPN).
154;positive;I need to transform this: into this: I tried to use wrapAll with jquery, something like that: Any suggestions would be really appreciated :) Thank you very much!

I 'm pretty good at C# and making apps. I just need to learn how to send data from and to a server/ mobile application. I am using PROPN( The latest one) as the API for my windows phone app. At the moment, a" PROPN world" sort of program would be awesome. Any help is is extremely appreciated! PROPN
160;neutral;No I did not. The question is- which files ..
161;negative;Sorry, I was n't clear. You would need to add that as a PROPN property on your class. It originally sounded as if you had a single place that handled the notifications and displayed the errors.
162;neutral;What matters is that your code is readable. If you 're worried, add a comment -- that 's what they 're for! Having said that, maybe you should PROPN when there are no more players.
163;positive;I have created a new project using core data then copied all of the app delegate code for core- data that i need over into my current projects PROPN delegate .. my appdelegate.m looks like this now. My questions are as follows Is the URLForResource in this part of the code ment to reflect the name of my xcdatamodeld that I have created? With the URLByAppendingPathComponent: do i have to create a sqlite database called Code.sqlite or is this made automatically for me by the core- data code? what is the purpose of this method exactly? any help or tips would be really awesome!
164;neutral;Also, your query is completely vulnerable to PROPN injection. If you do n't know what that is, look it up.
165;positive;very kind :) PROPN PROPN approach is a good one as it acts like a polyfill.
166;positive;PROPN- Absolutely. I was never to solve this PROPN issue and ended up creating mirror images for my sprites. I praised the genius who created keyboard shortcuts that day!
167;neutral;Just use the appropiate font and enclose your string with an asterix.
168;negative;I 'm having trouble setting the default character set of my PROPN.( and was a bit afraid of messing it up!)
169;negative;@Gary it is indeed strange enough that` Files` does not have a recursive deletion method ... That sounds like an obvious thing to have. But it probably is n't. How to deal with errors, for instance  
170;neutral;PROPN, I 'm not saying that all singletons are evil, I 'm saying that they are considered such and for a reason. I myself use them sometimes, but I often find that I would be better of without them. I 'm not going to start a flame war about singletons here, but if there is a doubt( otherwise, why ask a question?) ... Maybe there 's enough of a reason not to use them?
171;neutral;The most correct/ idiomatic solution( if you can not avoid having a collection to begin with) is to use an: Putting the into a lambda is n't going to make anything any easier. In fact, it 'll only create more work. Of course if you really hate using an you can avoid it, not that it 'll really help you much: You could emulate the more functional style concept with a method that invokes an action if the object is n't, not that this is really any easier than a check when dealing with actions instead of functions:
172;negative;Oh, bummer, I think i got i right now?
173;positive;I think PROPN is in incorrect format. Try this: Change the in your PROPN to Try adding following when request is made: If still it does n't work, then try PROPN method in your class. Now make an object of and call method and here you can see your required JSON format. After you get required JSON format, then try sending JSON in that format. Hope this will help! Thanks
174;positive;Try: This should make it open as a pop- up( unless default browser setting are different)Although it 's not recommended to use pop ups anymore because most users find it extremely annoying. Hope this helped.
175;positive;Great to hear! Good luck implementing. If you have any questions, feel free to ask :)
176;negative;Most of the times when PROPN program crash, compiler show stack with full of PROPN 's, but these no 's do n't make any sense to me. Very rarely it point out where the problem might be and mostly there are these useless no 's. How you can make sure that when your program crashes while development/ testing, it shows at what place this cause this crash?
177;neutral;You can just see all the PROPN PROPN and you 'll be fine! PROPN a PROPN with PROPN Deleting a cookie is very simple. Just set the expires parameter to a passed date:
178;positive;PROPN excellent answer!! you save my day!!! I forgot that PROPN and res handle only one connection, so I do nt try to call res.end(). Thank you very much!
179;neutral;There was a great answer to the first half of this on   , the second half god a good answer from the manpage, as posted by rmcfrazier:    combinatorics:"There are devastating collision attacks on PROPN.( ...) In contrast, PROPN appears to be much more secure. While there are some known attacks on PROPN, they are much less serious than the attacks on PROPN. For this reason, PROPN is a much better choice than PROPN in many settings."- MD5"Warning: This function does not create random nor unpredictable strings.

I have tried everything and I currently have this in its place I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to successfully set whatever is in this field As a variable in the ajax script that I have. All help is extremely appreciated, thanks for the help!
182;neutral;Update: I 've tried the PROPN PROPN 1.5, 1.6 and PROPN PROPN 1.5 to make sure this network behaviour was n't VM- specific.
183;positive;I 'm really glad it worked! PROPN, the best way to show appreciation on PROPN PROPN if someone helps to solve your problem is to upvote their answer and mark it as solved :)
184;positive;I have a javascript document.write function that returns a textarea value to a field like so: Now, I need the output of what is returned from the document.write part to be in PROPN output, so if the value fetched from the document.write function is[ PROPN], it returns" hello" not[ PROPN]. Any help would be extremely appreciated!
185;positive;Edited my post. Hope it helps; and feel free to keep asking questions!
186;negative;Is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file? I find this extremely annoying, but it is the only way I can find. Scenario: I 'll find a variable that needs renaming( Usually to meet naming convention) I 'll rename the variable in the aspx/ PROPN file. I 'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace. I get annoyed Are there any better ways- preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project. I 'm on VS2008 with resharper -- does PROPN address this perhaps?
187;neutral;At a guess, you 're probably defining your objects in PROPN as just PROPN, something like this: If so, you 're forcing PROPN to go through the automation interface( PROPN). Basically, it does n't know what type you 're going to assign to until run- time, so it has to invoke methods on that object via PROPN. To do that, it looks up all the information it needs for an invocation from the object itself at run time. By contrast, your PROPN code is probably early- bound, which means offsets into the PROPN object 's vtable are compiled directly into your code. In that case, when/ if you change the code so those offsets are n't valid any more, the code will fail horribly.
188;neutral;PROPN()
189;negative;I 've done some easy .hover(function() statement in PROPN. When i hover over a text i simply want a# div.fadeIn, and on non- hover PROPN. It works. But it 's just if i spam the text- trigger with PROPN and PROPN- hoverring really quickly and then stop the animation begin to give a blinking effect. It just kind of loops, really annoying!
190;negative;damn PROPN thats what i was afraid of!!
191;positive;First: I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application. Excellent! But, as you said: PROPN can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, PROPN is called. This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access- able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.
192;negative;You could try this one( not optimal, I am afraid ):
193;neutral;I 'm working on a PROPN PROPN which, in the end, will require me to create reports based on business hours. Currently, my time dimension is granular to the hour. I 'm wondering if I should be modifying my PROPN dimension to include a bit field for" business hour" or should I be creating some sort of calculated measure for it on the analysis end? Any examples would be super magnificent?
194;neutral;Are you referring to the D version?
195;neutral;I was planning to use it with PROPN.
196;positive;Never knew about PROPN macros. It 's awesome!!! Just what I need in a couple scenarios. Thanks a lot
197;positive;Wow, you guys reply quickly! I 'm having a hard time following up here :)
198;positive;You have to created a new model for hold referral code. below are given model syntax. add These lines in your last lines your models.py PROPN mention line will create your user profile at the time of creating user. Hope this work for you!!!
199;positive;I just use following code right now. The table is PROPN 90 MB. terms has FULLTEXT PROPN and it is PROPN). There are 1,000,000 rows on the table. I wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on PROPN? Especially in terms of memory. By saying solution, I refer to any solution such as other types of databases, table structures etc. and if the solution would be adaptable to a standart VPS or hosting in general, it would be extremely super duper perfect! Thanks for your time!

202;negative;Official guide says: Tomcat deployment is trivial and requires copying the WAR file into the PROPN/ PROPN folder and restarting the container. But this is really painful :-( Does there any way to deploy app without restarting PROPN?
203;positive;found a solution, would still love to see alternatives!
204;positive;PROPN people THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWERS!!!!( bow)
205;positive;Wow! Actually, that 's nearly what PROPN wrote, but in code :) Hope that helps.
206;negative;I 've updated the fiddle. I had to use classes to get it to work, so its not 100% perfect imo.
207;negative;I used multiple requests- batches of 10. I do n't want to anger the PROPN!
208;neutral;A generic" PROPN" method would be a simple example. T Sum(IEnumerable sequence)
209;positive;I stumbled upon this site and really loved the way they have done the navigation on the left hand site. I noticed that site is using jquery but did nt see any plugins. Any ideas on how to go about doing this?
210;neutral;its a very weird behaviour!

212;negative;I just wrote this function, so there are no versions to speak of ... I 'm afraid I 'm not very faimiliar with mapping!
213;negative;I 'm a novice programmer who is attempting assembly for the first time. Sorry in advance if this is an incredibly lame question. I have a character stored in the PROPN register, but I need to move it to my DL register. When I try: PROPN PROPN, eax I get an error C2443: operand size conflict. I know that the eax register is 32 bit while the PROPN is 8 bit ... am I on to something?? How do I go about solving this.
214;positive;updated the answer. This might help you! Great! then you might want to edit the java program and have the permission specified while the folder is created did you try PROPN with 777 permission via terminal or php?
215;positive;I have no clue if this approach would be feasible or not, but then there are two things you could try:1.Create a singleton class where you and the arraylist. The class might look like this: To access the list you could write: is the name of the getter method and before getting it set it. Else you might get .Also a receiver might start before the list is filled. So always check for null before you use it.2.The other option is you store the list in a cache object like Check for even in this case in the broadcast receiver before using it. Hope that helps!
216;negative;You need to or if you target PROPN PROPN 8.1.And port you code to PROPN 11 the call is. It will be painful! You will still use this feature level.
217;neutral;The problem here is that you already stringified the response as JSON before passing that into another data structure( now as a string) in order to return that as JSON. So you are basically doing a double encode and the" string" gets encoded. So just pass in the data once: So on a small collection like this: PROPN get a result like this: If you are really worried about the order of those two keys then you can use the bson" dumps" to go to a string then decode with the standard PROPN decoder in order to get a native dict with the PROPN objects deserialized, then further put into your ordered dict. But really your client should not care about the order of the keys and just expect those root elements.
218;negative;The plan of making a mum/ dad accessible PROPN page was growing for me the last few days, but now caffeine and this bug just filled me with angry rage( the green kind)

When i try to upload my video my filename.flv in the folder/ images/ stories/ videos/, i am getting the error as PROPN Agility_VS.flv: unknown Bytes: 0% PROPN PROPN!: Unknown error or disk quota exceeded. What may be the problem in this?? Even i have increased the size of the destination folder. But still i am getting this error. Why i am getting the PROPN PROPN error.
221;positive;You have at wrong place, that must be in element, so You should try like: Referred from Here PROPN it will help you!
222;negative;I really hate PROPN, your code looks as if you are looking forward to publishing your project finalized with PROPN .. Anyhow .. if your looking to replace the jquery selector$("") with a function you should know that the function requires that it returns a DOM element. otherwise an error will be flagged and java script with abort.
223;negative;That really stinks! I was afraid of that ...
224;positive;I know that there is a PROPN. PROPN. Remove command but I have not found a way to list out all the current assigned groups so I could loop through and remove them. Hope this helps you guys!
225;positive;Oops! Yeah, that was just radio functionality PROPN. It turns out this is n't as straightforward as I thought. Give me a few minutes and I think I can fix it.
226;neutral;In Rails the ids are assigned by the database using a sequence or autoincrement integer field type.
227;positive;Great! I Will take a look later. Cheers.
228;positive;I have just read and I really loved to the question. Naturally, an interesting question popped in my head ... How to add my own events( of my own applications) in the PROPN PROPN-> PROPN and PROPN PROPN-> PROPN-> PROPN Events? And another related question, that I suppose should be answered here as well is ... How do I play those sounds specified in the PROPN PROPN, when the event in my application occurs?
229;neutral;Then I can suggest you to use go through advanced search form php tutorial or use the PROPN plugins.
230;negative;that 's PROPN( I do n't need it for debugging, I need it for other purpose.
231;positive;I have an old friend who is a mathematician. He has his own math to compress his formulas, which are incredibly beautiful. He works in a program called PROPN, which transforms the formulas for 3D- shapes. I wonder if it is possible to obtain these figures using PROPN and PROPN? See attached formula and figure. I know little of this myself. But I would be delighted if some one could show me an example.
232;neutral;I running an exe from a .NET app and trying to redirect standard out to a streamreader. The problem is that when I do myprocess.exe>> PROPN out.txt is close to 14 mb. When I do the command line version it is very fast but when I run the process from my csharp app it is excruciatingly slow because I believe the default streamreader flushes every 4096 bytes. Is there a way to change the default stream reader for the PROPN object?
233;negative;SORRY! had some syntax issue, i fixed it and it works now ... what should i do with the question?
234;negative;The function is extremely annoying because it uses a prototype or something insane like that. You 'd have to do an ampersand- call to override the prototype: PROPN, you are trying to transpose the matrix, not to it( which would produce a continuous list like We could use an iterator in conjunction with: which works, but this is severely overthinking the problem. Let 's just swap indices:
235;positive;What is the problem? Create additional page and add it to PROPN, PROPN code there, and make an output page whatever you want. If you know PROPN it will take you 15 min.
236;positive;Hope it works, if you can upvote my answer I 'd really appreciate it! :)
237;positive;I found an excellent tutorial on how to create site columns and content types- here:( THANKS AGAIN PROPN!) Does anyone know of a written or video tutorial that will explain how to create a list and list instance in PROPN 2007. I use PROPN PROPN, and the build in templates from PROPN are n't compatible( or up to the task). Preferably a method that focuses on the PROPN( PROPN), and explains in detail the theory, and demonstrates how it is done. Thank you.
238;positive;Sure play around it, PROPN is easy it will just take a bit of time to get used to the structure.
239;neutral;Added bounty to see if I can get a full answer( ideally: the code snippet that, when added above, answers the question).
240;neutral;Please take a look at PROPN PROPN:
241;positive;i get it! i guess you are right
242;neutral;I can point what you should do then: 1. create script.php and clean all input variables from search page. 2. connect to the database and make a select statement" .. WHERE grad='$ PROPN' .. 3. protect your form from mysql injection.
243;positive;That is great news!
244;positive;You are very welcome! Learn programming, it 's a lot of fun!
245;neutral;( I 'm assuming you do n't have a PROPN is no easy/ clean way to do this in PROPN. In your query, you 'll have to build a calculation for each year in your output. So, something like this for 2013: And basically the same for 2014.Cut the PROPN piece out of your crossab. Then you 'll nest those two calcs under your years. To get rid of all the zeroes or nulls, select the two columns. From the menu, select,, PROPN, you will drop a calc in next to your Years in the crosstab( not under them). The expression will be( or whatever you end up naming your calcs). PROPN it as a percent, and you should be good to go. Told you it was a pain!
246;negative;Sorry -- Current output is raw HTML as far as I know. I 'll double check that, though. PROPN -- I suppose that is what I 'll have to do. Looks quite scary, though!
247;positive;If you read the FB.init documentation, there are some parameters that can be used while defining. One of the parameter is which- Determines whether PROPN tags used by social plugins are parsed, and therefore whether the plugins are rendered or not. Defaults to false. You said that in case of pure javascript the like plugin worked that 's beacause you must have set to. To get your jquery code to work simply define this paramter to true which is false by default- and it shall work. Good luck!
248;positive;No worries and good luck with it! ;)
249;neutral;A couple of issues with your code that may be causing the problem is as follows: Do not EVER escape binary data prior to insertionInserting binary data from an upload into the database is a huge no- no. This can inadvertently lead to some very malicious attacks on your server that extend beyond simple PROPN injection. That being said, it is not know what the field type is that you are trying to store into, nor how large the image file is. Storing a 2 PROPN upload as a field in a database is probably not a wise idea, but if you wanted to store large images, it is recommended to stream the data into a PROPN field. For smaller files, you can them safely into fields or if allocated enough space.
250;negative;Have you tried removing' preload' attribute?( PROPN I ca n't be much help otherwise!)
251;neutral;A smarter, entirely PROPN of doing what you want is using. Especially helps you to accomplish what you want. Please see the excellent about how to use it!
252;negative;Ok, I find the reason: device wo n't answer to simple user( and does n't matter what permissions did you ask in program manifest). You can directly speak to device only if you are root( or from PROPN mode). That means you can not use devices directly from general applications. Very sad :(
253;neutral;What about Signed zero. -0.0 vs Unsigned zero 0.0
254;neutral;The PROPN file can store various image types: PROPN( PROPN/ PROPN) PROPN PROPN- color RGB full- color The storing of actual image data is done differently for each image type. The is not the scariest I have seen, but it is definitely not trivial!

I 've deleted all of the content inside and restarted. Visting the ip of the server simply results in a page with one word on it: I just do n't get it. Is this normal nginx behaviour? I 've deleted the entire conf file and restarted, so why is this happening?
264;neutral;PROPN be:
265;neutral;Firstly, that 's not how works. You have to specify constants for each, and those constants will be compared to the expression in parentheses( in your case,). That is how works, period. Secondly, switch is not faster than several s And thirdly, you should n't really worry about miniscule performance optimizations when you 're dealing with javascript.
266;negative;Compare these two methods: Aside from the method signatures( bar can declare instead of), is there any practical difference between the two methods? To be clear: I 'm aware that this is a horrible approach to exception handling, and should not be done!
267;positive;Excellent article! Very useful :)
268;neutral;You are just too quick ... you scooped my answer
269;negative;This is one of the shortcomings of PROPN that I absolutely hate and why I almost always bind to an PROPN of an anonymous type.

By all elements, I mean PROPN, s etc. It 's absolutely amazing for me from the accessibility point of view!
275;negative;Still printed but had that dreaded extra page! -_-
276;positive;I started to be thrilled only to find out that the example is ascii art!
277;positive;Here is the good example of getting twitter- like PROPN for PROPN PROPN., its really awesome!!!!! It provides: cascade views orientation support bouncing effect
278;positive;Excellent answer, thanks! Wish I could give you more points.
279;negative;I have developed a cumulative sum function as defined below in the PROPN library PROPN. However, I have run into an issue when combining this function with the transpose operation. All 3 of the following operations take well under a second: However, if I write: performance degrades horrendously. While each individual operation in isolation takes well under a second on a 1920x1080 image, when combined they now take 30+ seconds ... Any ideas on what could be causing this? My gut tells me it has something to do with delayed arrays, not forcing at the right time, etc ... But I do not have enough experience to track this down quite yet.
280;positive;No worries PROPN!
281;neutral;The following program prints 0, not PROPN as I expected. Why?
282;negative;If I have a setup project in a PROPN 2010 solution and I add/ remove another project, or unload/ reload another project any setup projects in the solution are expanded in the solution explorer. It only does this for setup projects and it is extremely annoying. Is there any way to disable this behaviour?
283;positive;sounds like desirable behaviour to me! How do you make it do that again?
284;positive;I appreciate your warm welcome, I never seen such a warm regard here for trying to be helpful, it was a really pleasant introduction and I want to thank you for taking your time to write- at last the end of the questions reads" If anyone has any ideas I would be extremely grateful!"
285;positive;Excellent point! Thanks!! I did mean just the left side though ..( I should have specified that). Was glad to learn your insight though ..
286;positive;Thanks. That was a really great pointer!
287;positive;Excellent, this works perfectly! Thank you :)
288;positive;Excellent, PROPN!
289;negative;PROPN that 's horrible :| and weird!!
290;neutral;I would not go the PROPN PROPN ... Have you considered using wpf?
291;neutral;Can you give us some more code?
292;neutral;Is it possible to pass 3 parameters into a selenium command via PROPN? e.g.
293;positive;excellent solution is in subclass PROPN add lines It 's work!
294;neutral;Use to insert data from another table
295;positive;Ahhh! I just made num_rows work( even though I do n't need it, as you pointed out) because of your indirect help! Thanks you sweetheart!
296;neutral;Including an external jsp page as an innerHtml from a javascript function
297;neutral;Maybe you can post the relevant code snippet? Regards, tamberg
298;neutral;I 'm getting a 404 when I try to check that link ... do you need to edit the html?
299;positive;PROPN PROPN 's site has a lot of examples of how to do this without javascript. It 's a really excellent resource.
300;negative;yes it does it in PROPN as well. Very annoying!
301;positive;Yes, you need two view controllers. Check out lesson 7 from PROPN CS193P PROPN PROPN PROPN course. It is available online. Both slides and the lecture through PROPN PROPN I really enjoyed watching the course!
302;negative;Out of all that pseudocode, the only thing that really worries me is" extracts code samples from file". Reading files from a directory is trivial, saving a file is trivial. Regardless of the test framework I 'd spend most of my time focusing on the parsing bit. For direct testing, I 'd embed the snippets directly into the test case: Ah, I see another change I subtly made while writing the test: my ExamplesToCode.parse() returns an PROPN( or other iterable container), so that it can be tested apart from the iteration itself.
303;positive;no worries! it happens all the time.
304;negative;as you can see folks hate spending time giving details on bad advice!
305;neutral;We can do this quite neatly using numpy, without having to worry about the channels at all! output: input:
306;neutral;Answer coming late. But anyway ... here goes: If it 's indeed PROPN PROPN) PROPN and not PROPN then it 's not a' sinister' COBOL packed field but a simple 4 byte integer!
307;positive;I ended up using, which met all my needs and is( PROPN) very excellent.
308;negative;Back in the day I had to solve this with a panel where the text box is a component inside and had PROPN set to 3 or 4 pixels. I 'd then style that panel to a single pixel. I always found this really annoying!
309;negative;the two are not mutually exclusive, archmage.
310;neutral;+1 for code sample
311;positive;Wow great answer and very quick   Explained everything.
312;positive;Excellent, injekt!!! Loved the way you answered.
313;positive;Absolutely. Do n't be afraid to just try stuff out!
314;neutral;@sll: Not True ... See my Edit
315;negative;That 's what I thought ... but I 'm terrible with PROPN Absolutely terrible.
316;negative;That 's really sad ...
317;positive;There is a particularly efficient algorithm using PROPN PROPN sequences described on PROPN PROPN PROPN 's excellent page: It works in 13 operations without branching!
318;negative;If I delete this question will it increase my reputation? 5 down votes it really sad.
319;neutral;Pragmatic approach: See other answers for excellent backgrounders!
320;positive;Loving PROPN, so far! Now I 'd like this initial layout ... ... to turn into this layout on a smaller screen: Is this possible using PROPN? Furthermore, I 'd want the PROPN- column to function as a single entity when they 're in the same column, since I 'd like to give them sticky behavior.
321;neutral;PROPN, it needs to be server side, no javascript
322;neutral;Too many`"`. You need:``
323;neutral;The question is tagged winforms
324;neutral;How can I increase PROPN heap size for PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN?
325;negative;Shameeeee on me!!!
326;negative;I need from document object or from a PROPN element( i.e. a PROPN) to know which is its window object. In PROPN I can do: but obviously in that PROPN browser that statement not work!!!
327;neutral;How can i extract data from a PROPN array .. PROPN and PROPN are indexes of the array
328;negative;I have a fairly large codebase with several directories and files and I would like to check out a view or have a view as of a given date( PROPN 12th). I am manually checking file histories and doing and this is extremely painful. I wonder if there is a way to do a checkout and load everything as of a particular day at once?
329;positive;You might want to look into JAXB. If you have a defined XML schema it will automatically create java classes that will easily allow you to' marshal'( move data from PROPN-> XML) and much much more. It 's incredibly useful!
330;neutral;Using a Inside the delegate for the PROPN. PROPN put this:
331;positive;No worries! PROPN does a poor job of emulating other browser versions.
332;negative;I 've discovered that my PROPN code is a lot flatter than my PROPN code. Do n't know why.
333;negative;After I changed my windows regional setting from my native language to PROPN, the problem has gone. Do not forget to restart PROPN PROPN. really annoying problem!
334;positive;my pleasure :) :)
335;positive;Related: PROPN PROPN put this up last week, pretty awesome!
336;neutral;PROPN PROPN   _rfer from PROPN has some really excellent examples of how to utilize Set::extract to get multiple values from various nested data structures
337;neutral;Do need this for existing documents or generated on fly ones?
338;positive;You can try the( very) comprehensive PROPN 's OR go with this simple workaround: And then declare the attribute as an integer: This worked very fine for me! =D
339;neutral;You can use with an existing profile:
340;neutral;I 've been having a spam problem on my site, where people sign up and act extremely abusive to other users of my site. I can easy PROPN ban them, except they always come back under a different PROPN address through a proxy or PROPN. So I was curious if there are any php classes or functions that can look up the PROPN and determine if its a genuine user, or someone behind a proxy, in which case it would muzzle their accounts upon registration.
341;negative;This would introduce scaling artifacts and might look extremely ugly.
342;negative;It 's impossible to receive unicast UDP packets in PROPN( rage!!!).
343;neutral;Not that I recommend this, but totally abusing LINQ the following would work:
344;neutral;Does anyone know how to enable locking on a PROPN column in PROPN 4.1.1?
345;neutral;Working on providing source code now, and no. PROPN PROPN seems to suffer the least!
346;neutral;And sometimes, if the system is hanging, keyboard might be the only way ..
347;neutral;Is it possible to get a visitor flow associated with a given ga: transactionId through the PROPN PROPN PROPN? There 's limited availability in PROPN: landingPagePath, PROPN: PROPN, PROPN: PROPN and PROPN: pageDepth but a more complete path would be desirable Thanks!
348;negative;I agree with this. For* non- essential services* increasing timeouts is incredibly frustrating.
349;negative;There 's an error here:$ PROPN only has one result column( which you have n't given a name). Are you sure you are using the correct variable because there 's no way that your code should work as you have posted it. Also your variable naming is really awful. Use meaningful names instead of,, etc ...
350;negative;OK, then, no solution that going PROPN mysql ... so sad! :-( i will close the question!
351;negative;PROPN that 's really sad, and I have to hand- code stuff.
352;neutral;What 's a' PROPN'? I 'm aware of PROPN and PROPN.
353;negative;" in the second instance run the designer, and the breakpoint will PROPN ... does not fire ...
354;negative;That is awful advice! I do n't mean to be overtly mean but I lolled.
355;neutral;So, which solution did you go for in the end?
356;negative;Oh, absolutely horrible practice. But still the answer he was looking for.
357;positive;The link works for me. That is a pretty awesome testing class! Thanks PROPN. I think I am going to convert and use that in my PROPN project. Thanks for the tip about PROPN, PROPN PROPN I 'll have a look at that too! :)
358;negative;Effective, but what a pain! You 'd think there 'd be an easier way.
359;neutral;C++ is n't dying, but most of its strengths only shine in niche markets.
360;negative;Putting data in the PROPN is a terrible, terrible idea.
361;neutral;Absolutely: PROPN is The Thing to use for JSON- based/ aware web services.
362;neutral;This only works if the compiler switch PROPN is turned on
363;positive;PROPN(   is a pretty excellent library for this purpose.
364;positive;Excellent! Exactly what I needed :)
365;neutral;PROPN- PROPN why do you said not to let the PROPN concat the strings?
366;neutral;do you have access to PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN for Testers?
367;positive;@Andremoniy this is an excellent idea! But what if this is legacy code?
368;positive;PROPN for PROPN!
369;negative;avoid the auto method, to apply by hand is such painful :(
370;neutral;worked for me too ..
371;negative;Somewhat new to PROPN( i.e. C programmer converting to PROPN) and can not figure out why my data members in my backpack class are empty. I make pass an array of potions to my backpack, yet the data members are saying PROPN PROPN""( i.e. nothing). I have never felt this lost in a program before. Starting to hate PROPN( i.e. kidding ... but this extremely frustrating). main.cpp potion.cpp backpack.cpp
372;positive;Excellent! You just gave me a lesson :)
373;neutral;I am not sure if it does, I will check into that. That may be the solution I need.
374;negative;Tools-> PROPN-> PROPN& PROPN-> PROPN and Run" On PROPN, when projects are out of date:" PROPN" Always Build" That 's it, had it myself, extremely annoying.
375;negative;I got to this question via the PROPN PROPN. To complement on what PROPN said above, for those of you on PROPN you might want to take a peek at /Applications/ PROPN/ PROPN/ PROPN/ vim/ runtime/ indent/ html.vim and the modifications necessary should become evident. I ca n't believe I spent so much time suffering from poorly indented< li> PROPN!
376;positive;excellent, thanks to both of you!
377;neutral;No, n% 7+ 1 actually returns n+ 1 unless n== 7 in which case it returns 1.
378;neutral;You 're missing a. on your class selectors: should be and should be
379;positive;Excellent hint! I was using scrollTo(0,0) and it was doing nothing
380;neutral;To stop it:
381;negative;From my experiences so far, I 've concluded that the PROPN PROPN scheme was really terribly designed. My site serves a manifest file when a user is logged in. Unfortunately, when they log out, they can still access the cached protected materials. Can anyone think of a way to fix this?
382;neutral;how to add SelectedIndexChanged event for PROPN in PROPN?
383;negative;Someone is scared to tell the reason of -1!
384;positive;Well, you are really brave! Implementing a PROPN provider all be yourself ...
385;negative;Although, using this outside testing is a horrible, horrible idea ...
386;neutral;
387;neutral;I see the outcome: A 's do work what s the things you are expecting?
388;negative;Can I fix the width and the height of jQueryMobile dialog? Currently, the size of width is 100% which is really awful in PROPN.
389;positive;If you want to search give PROPN PROPN 's excellent tool a try( its free!) but it 's only for PROPN PROPN though.
390;negative;Maybe someone knows how to disable content assist only on' else' keyword when working with PROPN source editor in PROPN? As I really, really hate it with this keyword, because after newest release it 's really messing with my workflow as after entering' else' and pressing enter it replaces it with: and sometimes it decides to get rid of indents completely. Mind you I do n't want to disable content assist completely, I just want to disable it for' else' keyword.
391;neutral;If you really worry about the performance, divide the page content into separate section and run the search process parallel!!!
392;positive;Check out PROPN PROPN 's excellent class. It provides really excellent information in the exception messages when you have this kind of mapping issue.
393;positive;You should really check out this plugin: I have been using it for about 10 sites and it 's really great! Since the latest update it 's posible to export your custom fields to a PROPN file which you can include your functions.php
394;neutral;oh ok ... I forgot php considered empty strings as FALSe, though it was just 0 and null
395;neutral;it really does crash my vm
396;neutral;have edited my answer to include the bitdepth
397;positive;Excellent, I 'm glad that worked for you!
398;neutral;+1. I do this in several querying libs, especially the ones that flow through to web services.
399;neutral;What is your current function?
400;neutral;Which language and/or regex engine is it for?
401;neutral;Yup because I am doing a search, unless you know another way.
402;positive;Well, I was using the setControlValueToUpperCase() method too soon it seems. So changing my keydown first if statement to fixed my issue. PROPN Me!!
403;neutral;For example: How would I go about summing the cost of items?( so I 'd get 60)
404;negative;I am developing a web page which embedded a" PROPN maps" view. In this web page, the user must specify several positions on the maps At this time, I am able to spread the balloons on the map displayed when the user click on a button to be dragged, but according to the zoom it can be very painful to zoom in and out to drag the balloon to a place. I would like to know if it could be possible to have a panel with all balloons to drag/ drop on the map? My current development: My target:
405;positive;+1 excellent.
406;positive;Excellent! Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks.
407;neutral;Is there a convenient way to check if a directory is empty using PROPN?
408;positive;you actually can use PROPN tech to apply on that beside, you can use a gem' client- side validation' the PROPN is here I suggest you use the gem ... pretty awesome :D
409;neutral;What 's the expected vs resulting behaviour? More info needed.
410;neutral;You can define an PROPN. and a little more on the how- to side ...
411;neutral;PROPN command does n't work with PROPN
412;negative;Horribly inefficient! It re- encodes the image each time. Try this instead.
413;neutral;You have to be excruciatingly careful when there are spaces in the path names. In the context, you probably need: You do n't need quotes around the variable this time.
414;positive;I am using' simpLESS' program to compile my .less files into .css files on the fly. It is really great! However, after using it only for couple of days,' PROPN' stopped copiling the .less into .css files. I have tried to reinstall, redownload and then reinstall, tried other directories, other .less files, tried recompiling manuall- but nothing works. Has anyone experienced this? Thanks!
415;negative;Oh, this was was a pain! I probably lost 2 hours on this. Here is the solution: CMake uses short' C' applications to test/ try things. If the CMakeLists.txt states that PROPN is used for the project, without also listing C, then some of those shorts tests incorrectly fail, and cmake then thinks those things are n't found. The solution was to change the first line of CMakeLists from this: ... to include C as a language: Then delete, recreate it, and everything then works:
416;neutral;I m afraid you ca nt do that!!!
417;neutral;I would 've answered PROPN, but it 's not open- source :)
418;positive;We are now 2 years after migrating to PROPN. Just upgraded to 2013. The team absolutely love it and ca n't even think about the old svn days!
419;negative;I am building the PROPN OS on PROPN PROPN( PROPN), and PROPN as an PROPN. I am trying to understand certain parts of the OS however this requires performing many searches throughout the project. These searches take 5 or 10 minutes on PROPN, and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying. Also, I need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the OS, since if they are opened in PROPN there is no color coding of the PROPN syntax. I feel that PROPN is really slowing me down- can anyone suggest a better IDE for browsing the PROPN OS( preferably free)?
420;negative;I recently worked on a product that was targeted to .NET 3.5. Out of hundreds of beta testers, I can probably count on one hand the number that already had .NET 3.5. The rest had to sit through the absolutely painful .NET 3.5 install from PROPN( ~30 minutes, and most of the time the progress bar stays near PROPN so people think it is broken).
421;positive;+1 for makeself. I totally loved that. :)
422;neutral;Test code: How do I remove the whitespaces before storing it into the array?
423;negative;I wish I 'd have found this question yesterday, as it has been causing me grief for hours! Surely this is a bug with the emulator?
424;neutral;Yeah I agree, I use igoogle to read all the news at one place, check my gmail, gcalender, etc.
425;positive;Thanks so much for the excellent answers! All answers worked beautifully.
426;neutral;+1, PROPN is better than the accepted answer
427;neutral;PROPN: I happen to be on PROPN 5.5.17
428;neutral;Do n't rely too much on cplusplus.com
429;neutral;The search bots do n't care about hash tags. And if you are using them for some kind of flash or PROPN calls, you have more serious problems than your 301 redirects do n't work. Because unless you have the content in an alternate form, the search engines are not indexing your site and you are definitely suffering as far as SEO goes.
430;positive;That answer was extremely helpful PROPN, thanks for the pointer on that!
431;neutral;Why do nt you simply wrap the absolutely excellent PROPN with implicit conversions and such? Yes, it wo n't give you PROPN 's XML- native- syntax style out of the box ...
432;neutral;There 's no need to spawn new processes, simply re- use them between requests.
433;negative;I 'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly: do you know why? I guess it has to do with escaping, but what and where?
434;positive;Check out the PROPN repository. There is a plugin called PROPN GCM Its a very great one and has some great extras!
435;neutral;** As of PROPN 2010, PROPN is at 57%.**
436;negative;PROPN really hate the response limits on comments.
437;negative;clicking the zoom( or PROPN) button again, restores it. terribly silly- yes!
438;positive;I have used very successfully( with a tweakette here or there!)
439;negative;done ... PROPN makes you wait several minutes. I really hate that
440;negative;PROPN same problem, nothing. very disgusting
441;negative;Why do you need the class explicitly? Could n't you use the interface? Note that casting is not encouraged, which is why it looks so awful in PROPN!
442;neutral;This did n't seem to bring the existing window to the foreground when I tried it.
443;neutral;What is the equivalent of PROPN. ApplyCurrentValues for PROPN?
444;negative;It sounds very scary to me to use a floating point number for a key in a` map`.
445;positive;Excellent thanks!
446;positive;The PROPN PROPN PROPN posted a EXCELLENT article about chromeless windows available here: This is a MUST read!!! PROPN Also found article by PROPN PROPN on how to use the PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN for a custom window chrome
447;negative;Ahw ... that 's plain sad :(
448;positive;No worries man!
449;positive;@Stilly.stack wooow I did n't know that that was important!! thanks a lot :)
450;positive;in about 4 months from now I should be able to show you one= P
451;positive;I 'm trying to make a link inside the fancybox single image title. I want it to redirect me to another fancybox window( witch is inline) ... I have a script that makes the whole single image a link, but this targets my document title instead of the anchor title ... I really hope someone will have a solution or a better idea on how to do it!! :) Thank you thank you thank PROPN! PROPN btw: I have almost never worked with scripts .. In depth anyways ...
452;neutral;I can only help if I can see the full( ie. non- compressed) source code. The code included on the website has been modified( from jqDock v1.6 source) and re- compressed, which makes it extremely difficult( understatement!) to tell what has been changed.( I have also responded- with the same answer- to a direct email from the poster)
453;neutral;Are you using PROPN or PROPN?
454;neutral;I voted up your question because I want to do the same thing.
455;positive;Excellent! Thanks for the additional detail PROPN!
456;positive;There 's 2 parts to this question, both about PROPN: How can we post up 2 values email and password, and deal with the response using the object mapper How can we map 2 objects in a response We are expecting the following JSON response: What 's the correct way to map this out, we 've got a class setup for PROPN and PROPN, but all the examples i 've seen seem to not show something like this where there is two segments to the response, here 's the code we have at the moment: Appreciate any help you can give on this, loving PROPN so far!
457;negative;This is extremely ugly C- style code, easy to get wrong. While the bugs in your code have been fixed by earlier birds, here is the PROPN way to do this:
458;neutral;You do n't know if threads are killed unless you catch a signal that tells you so!
459;neutral;Return some JSON with the state ... Then some PROPN should do it ...
460;positive;PROPN, superb, charm :) Thank you!
461;negative;I am working on an app that uses some basic view types, but I find the default attributes extremely ugly in PROPN( for example, a bright yellow). I can get the basic seekbar if I create it from code, using only the parameter, but I would like to know if there is a way to do this inside an PROPN PROPN file. Is there an attribute I can set that will remove all default attributes- such as?
462;neutral;Need to do it without using any swing or other PROPN as background process.
463;negative;@BoristheSpider :( :( That is really sad. :(
464;positive;Excellent answer!
465;neutral;I drew a circle using this code: how can i write a or event for this circle?
466;positive;If this is true that 's excellent news! I 'll give it a try next app update ...
467;positive;There are some really great answers here that I wholeheartedly agree with!
468;neutral;Is there any way we could implement vertical lines in a jquery file tree?
469;positive;PROPN, What an excellent tool! I will be using this ALOT in future! :-)
470;negative;I am experiencing exactly this problem( and am in exactly the same world of pain ): Whereby I am offering an update to PROPN using PROPN and it is failing with a because is set to. Due to legacy databases also on the server I am targeting, I am not able to re- configure the default connection settings as is quite rightly stated in the accepted answer in. My question is: How do you convince PROPN to run a PROPN before executing an update?
471;neutral;Here is another one to consider
472;positive;Here are my tables. And here are my object classes I 'm brand new to dapper and orm in general, so please bare with me. Would a many- to- many relationship be possible to map out with dapper? If so, could someone provide a coding sample, that would be extremely helpful! I am also open to switching to a heavier orm if that would make these advanced mapping scenarios a lot simpler.
473;neutral;You ca n't use multiple colors on an icon font, so what you ask is n't possible. You could use a partial background fill, but that does n't seem very desirable. If you switch to you would at least have access to symbols.
474;neutral;PROPN, this regex matches* 1* character from[ PROPN] character class.* Single* character.
475;negative;That 's horrible!!
476;positive;I 've been using PROPN grids lately for my column layouts, and I 'm loving them! Here 's a link to a great overview/ tutorial: This is a very easy and flexible solution, which scales well to even very complex layouts.
477;neutral;Replaced    with archive.org link ...
478;neutral;Is this possible? I have looked online and can not seem to find an answer.
479;positive;Excellent! Can you post it as an answer?
480;negative;can I replace my entire windows vista with PROPN and is it free? I really hate PROPN
481;positive;PROPN excellent suggestion! I had n't used` cherry- pick` before but that worked quite well. If you post as an answer I 'll accept.
482;negative;I 've been tackling the same issue. It 's a pain!
483;neutral;This is a common problem, and it 's not a matter of" PROPN is lying to me!" You have to understand how PROPN sends the emails, and how servers interpret and process them. Your email host is likely interpreting these emails as spam, and sending them to a quarantine folder. None of this has anything to do with how PROPN is handling your email.
484;negative;I found this great node mysql boilerplate: it works terrific! However, now I need to hook it in to my existing user table, and my key field is named PROPN, not simply i PROPN, and changing the key fieldname in mysql breaks the example. So my question is, where in the project do I need to specify a different i d field name? I see user.id in PROPN/ auth.js passport.serializeUser and i PROPN in passport.deserializeUser functions, but it seems it must be specified elsewhere too. I 'm hoping this is a simple question for users of passportjs!
485;neutral;OR do whatever you need to to make the bottom, left and right borders look right and then just hide the top border with this PROPN code:. Then feel really guilty about using it.
486;positive;Excellent answer!
487;neutral;Except he says PROPN right in the title. -1.
488;neutral;It 's possible to change color of UINavigationController view and buttons?
489;negative;I 'm trying to create some ads in PROPN, but on last step I always get error: but it did n't specify WHERE. I swear PROPN, there are no errors on whole page, all fields are correctly filled, I see no red shapes around fields, everything match criterias written under fields, but I stil get this error- without any explanation. Has anybody same experiences? It 's totally frustrating :(
490;negative;I 'm not sure that the given approach will work with hosts using PROPN/ PROPN.
491;neutral;I had on top of one of my rake files.
492;positive;Ah, excellent :)
493;neutral;you can use
494;neutral;The only way I 've found to do this is using the plugin hoverIntent:
495;neutral;@NWest You can use a` @table` variable, which is immune from transaction rollbacks, to not need all kinds of heinous workarounds.
496;negative;I do n't see how this is possible, but I really, really hate to run my query an extra time just to get the record count so I can build a pager. When I say a" pager" I simply mean the common gizmo with a link for each 10 records for example.
497;neutral;I had to iterate over the json object
498;positive;It sounds like you might want to use. It is extremely awesome. If you use PROPN, here 's how you could do it: PROPN PROPN for me: returns an array with 3 PROPN objects:
499;neutral;I mean when the form is posted.
500;neutral;I had left out PROPN, the new version works ...
501;neutral;Are the elements also initialized to' \0' when allocating memory to a string through malloc?
502;negative;there is no chance to add blank lines between PROPN PROPN in slim. closest solution to your case are adding comment such and but this is really painful
503;neutral;PROPN and sp_attach_db. It need not be point and click.
504;negative;Very scary! O_O
505;neutral;Where exactly do you hook your events inside your PROPN?
506;neutral;I 've created a div how would I make this div a child of using PROPN?
507;neutral;Have you declared the PROPN- PROPN in your bundle 's MANIFEST.MF
508;negative;So" options" always has one item, and" option" can have multiple? What a horrid API!
509;positive;I would really love if someone could tell me how to tell whether 2 objects have touched( An image or a button) I know how to make them draggable but not how to tell if they have touched and to do something when they touch! Thanks!
510;negative;Here is a solution that works for lower case strings only. Horrible horrible code, but I was trying to see how few lines I could write a solution in.
511;neutral;urllib.quote ought to help with this.
512;positive;Excellent! It works!
513;positive;@Marc- PROPN   PROPN Your answer there was incredibly helpful! Thank you!
514;neutral;Which version of PROPN PROPN are you using?
515;positive;Excellent! You, sir, need a PROPN button. Or join PROPN.
516;positive;+1 That s a very sexy way of getting days within a range!
517;negative;@AliceChen sad but sometimes the PROPN servers go down, this may also cause this!
518;negative;PROPN, the` com` prefix is horrible!
519;positive;I wanna make popover for add new event when user will click to day(" select" callback in jsEvent.pageX and PROPN parameter but PROPN where is this popup still sticked on clicked element looks better. So my working code for stick popup to some element: html I already tried something like this: But is n't working. Any help will very greatful!
520;positive;So I 'm using activerecord to get the count of items for a certain day: But this does n't give me if there are no records for a given day, how can I fix this? Or is there are more" Rails" way do to something like this? Any help is hugely appreciated, thanks again!
521;positive;@Leon PROPN: Excellent answer!!! Thanks loads ...
522;neutral;You have a data race because of the conflicting read/ write access to. This implies that the behavior of your program is not defined. The race condition on is the least of your worries: the program could do anything!
523;positive;very nice beautiful :-)
524;negative;I wrote something that does work, but it 's extremely ugly, but thought it could either help someone else or we could get something better. Here 's what I came up with:
525;positive;I am trying to create a plot of several data series that are contained in a pandas PROPN. Let 's use as an example: This code produces a simple line chart with two different data series: However, if I try and create this same plot in a PROPN widget using, I only get a single line. My code for the second example is a little more involved: When I run this code, the output looks like this: If anyone can shed any light on this, it would be hugely appreciated! Thanks.
526;positive;I need someone to point me in the right direction on this .... In my PROPN application I have a PROPN with custom views for each row containing various textviews each. I retrieve weather information for multiple locations and then want to write the results for each location to its own listview item. The question is, how do I refer to each textview on each listview item? I ca n't do it by name using, can I? If there are three items in the list, will the temperature textview for each item be names the same, just differ by an array index? If so, how do I specify PROPN), PROPN) and PROPN( 2) for the three list items? Yes, I 'm still very new to PROPN .... but loving it!
527;neutral;Something along these lines, perhaps?
528;positive;Awesome :)!!!!!
529;positive;this worked excellently, great job! :)
530;positive;Gosh! you 're right!!! Excellent!!!! Is there a way to expand it programatically? I added .setOngoing(true)( to the top) but it 's not expanded ...( not really the top because the first one is a notification when I 'm plugged to USB for tools developpement). Thank you again my friend!
531;positive;@Jon no worries!
532;neutral;It ca n't be closed, but you can remove the OK button by specifying a function as the 3rd parameter: But seriously think about this, because spawning unclosable dialog boxes wo n't exactly make people overjoyed about your site.
533;neutral;You should accept PROPN PROPN 's answer.
534;negative;Since ChangeSets are becoming too many to handle because of many checkins, I 'm thinking of selecting multiple changesets then create a single work item link for code review purposes. It 's really painful to create work item per changeset and assign to a code- reviewer. Is this possible?
535;neutral;I need to add some controls to context menu. Is it possible? If yes, how?
536;positive;I stumbled upon this site and really loved the way they have done the navigation on the left hand site. I noticed that site is using jquery but did nt see any plugins. Any ideas on how to go about doing this?
537;neutral;Is it possible to initialize objects of the type: via boost::assign::list_of
538;positive;That works! Very awesome :) How do I select your answer as the solution?
539;positive;excellent! exactly what I was looking for. Thanks PROPN.
540;neutral;In that case, try: ls -f| head -10
541;negative;I just installed PROPN in my System I am trying to create my Very PROPN PROPN. I set up JAVA_HOME and PROPN PROPN path that has been used previuosly by eclipse in PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN has the below versions for PROPN and PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN- PROPN PROPN PROPN- 19 As soon as started PROPN studio downloaded the PROPN in the below path C:\Users\DELL.gradle\wrapper\dists\gradle-1.12- all after that it shows the build screen as below. This screen is shown for ever. It is not moving further. can anyone help me in this. I am sad!
542;negative;Right, I 've got this horrible mess of html and PROPN( that does work!), but I want to do things properly and render the whole thing with the method. But I 'm not sure how to do this, I can only render text with the link_to at the moment.
543;positive;@KevinB what an excellent resource! That just made my life waaaaay easier!
544;neutral;i have: how can i get the innerHTML of the child of" td1"? dosen't work.
545;neutral;The project was moved to
546;neutral;this long: |-----------------|
547;negative;Sometimes in a long commit log, it 's really painful to navigate the all- expanded diffs.( You get expanded- diffs when hitting enter from the magit- blame- mode for example) Is there a way to collapse these diffs?
548;negative;It might be questionable, but not a cause for rejection as long as you have a fallback behavior when/ if the method can not be found. There are worse abuses that have passed.
549;positive;What options are there to pull a PROPN user creation date? I saw that the PROPN PROPN is capable of it, is it the only API capable of doing this? does any of the previous one also capable of? If possible using PROPN, it will be most excellent, Thank you!
550;negative;I am very jealous of your name!
551;positive;Excellent! Thanks for the link.
552;positive;I want to know what is good start point to work on creating own PROPN on iphone/ objective- c. I 've never done this part before, and I know I 'm kinda attracted to make my own slick PROPN, something like convertbot, which I really love :) Any suggestion would be appreciated! Thanks
553;positive;@hrbrmstr I already have a PROPN implementation. I have simply no time to switch to a different technology. I chose this because it makes R behave like PROPN and others, which means people can start to see R as a general purpose language ... something I 'd really love to happen!
554;neutral;What is the difference between the events vs? When does each event get hit?
555;neutral;Would n't it be easier to store a shared copy of it in the application class?
556;positive;This is excellent, thank you!
557;neutral;How do you convert the PROPN .docx file to an indexable( text) format? We use PROPN PROPN to get our PROPN .docx( and other office formats) indexed and this works pretty fine! You can have a look at the PROPN here:
558;positive;PROPN, great- great sample, does exactly what I was looking for!
559;neutral;If you do n't want to modify the file:
560;positive;Ok after a PROPN of searching I found the answer, which is relating to accessing request in PROPN custom template tags .... You can see the answer here: I used the following: and then changed the following line: I really hope this helps someone else! :-)
561;neutral;No, there is no performance difference if the view is essentially a
562;negative;When I click on PROPN PROPN the whole dashboard crashes and I have to login again. This is really worrying me as we are serving data to many users. A server error has occurred. Is there a way to see the internal logs? I ca n't see anything in nor. Is there any other way to reset the PROPN?
563;positive;Excellent work on that site by the way!
564;positive;This is answered. The concept was implementing with the tags such as and within the and PROPN. Excellent answer!
565;neutral;Edited my answer. It now references* PROPN and permalinks*.
566;negative;It 's PROPN! No, seriously, I do n't like it.
567;positive;Found the culprit! At first I tried the solution suggested by PROPN in the comment, it worked( I managed to create a folder) but the folder was n't usable as I could n't upload packages. I have db_owner permission on the MSDB database and so I can see and access the SSIS MSDB folder. What I really needed was the db_ssisadmin permission. Not to worry as db_owner permissions allow me to give myself the db_ssisadmin permission! After this was done, all the problems( the one in the original Q and more) disappeared.
568;positive;+1 PROPN explanation!
569;positive;PROPN 's PROPN code sample demonstrates how do do this with the callout and their PROPN PROPN sample shows how to do custom annotation views. There documentation is really excellent and these samples are both helpful.
570;negative;No, unless there 's a relevant PROPN zero day. Obviously, this would be a huge abuse of user privacy( if you want their name, ask them!).
571;negative;I have a function name called setValue, used in many classes. Also, i have a global function by the same name. When i press PROPN], it goes to arbitrary setValue function. How do i directly jump to the global setValue function? It is really pain to use tnext every time to find if the function global.
572;positive;I need to echo only selected lines from a .txt file using PROPN. The txt file content looks like this: The previous working code was echoing every lines. I 'm trying to get the same formating but only with the selected lines. For instance let say only lines: 3, 5, 8, 10. The second step would then be if the lines could be echoed in a different order than the initial one. If someone knows a simple way to do it, that would be excellent! Thanx in advance.
573;neutral;be very afraid?
574;positive;Thanks. First method is really great!
575;neutral;This works as of PROPN 3.1.416.3
576;positive;This sounds like an excellent project! You might want to start with the module. You might also be interested in the module. Perhaps to get you started, here 's a function that takes a path to a file and backs the file up by copying it and giving it a .bak extension.
577;negative;PROPN PROPN is still having this bug! Anyway there is a simple work around for now See more here: Be aware that PROPN() is total rubbish performance wise!
578;positive;Can anyone help me add children to a plist? I think I want to record an index of rows from the plist and then state which index row to write the key too. I 'm not sure how to say if the key will be a string, dictionary or array. The following is code from another question on adding a key to root. Any help would be extremely appreciated :)
579;positive;wow the reaction time on this by you guys was amazing xD I 'll give everyone +1 once I get to the 15 rep ^_^ Thank you so much everyone!
580;positive;Excellent! Glad that sorted it
581;neutral;That does n't seem to create a table ... any reasons why? I tried dbdelta too.
582;neutral;Here is a code in, I would like to run it with, optimizing if possible.
583;neutral;Which PROPN are we talking about: PROPN, PROPN, or( classic) PROPN?
584;negative;Oh, I am scared!
585;positive;I had the same exception, I just installed the latest VM release and now the compilation complete successfully :)
586;negative;You could also try PROPN PROPN PROPN: This gets very painful when you have to chain multiple functions, so you can break standard formatting:
587;positive;So, it is as simple as purchasing a domain name, and then adding that identifying information to the hosts file? If so, that is excellent!!
588;positive;Excellent! This should be marked as an answer. Very good solution.
589;neutral;can anyone give me simple code to create a line in iphone using drawrect?
590;neutral;Check out.
591;negative;I am completely hopeless with regular expressions ... I have a PROPN named, and I have a PROPN function named. Now I want to find all the places the PROPN function is called. So I need to search for" PROPN", where" PROPN" does n't start with the hash key. Any ideas?
592;negative;I use festAssertions in my tests and I noticed that using yields different results than in tests where hibernate objects are tested. I had to do workaround and now test looks really ugly but I can not use because that just does not work! Here is partial code(look at last line ): seasonRate, seasonRate1 are created and persisted. Then retrieved from PROPN and checked against originals. Nothing fancy, but does not work with festAssertions. Do you have any idea how to fix that and if it is some error on my side or not?
593;positive;This was a very quick and excellent way to show me everything I needed!
594;negative;I really despise PROPN for this very reason. Maybe you could give a try
595;negative;as was already established, this is a miserable, horrible, awful, and terrible idea from a concurrency perspective. Anyway, since your question is really about PROPN 's type system, here 's how you would define a type with a recursive method.
596;positive;I am using some PROPN script to add some data from a complex form to MySQL PROPN and then showing it all in some HTML table. Everything works just fine, but I would like to' upgrade' my script with PROPN and( I suppose) AJAX. What I would like to do is when user submits data, the row( or) shows up in the PROPN table without refreshing a page. Form and table are on same page, of course ... Some guidelines would be really helpful because I 'm not sure should I even use PROPN or something else for my needs. Links for some tutorials will be also great :) Thanks a lot for any help!
597;neutral;I am using PROPN mapping- by- code to map the classes. Sometimes, in order to debug my PROPN configuration, I would require to check exactly what were the settings passed over to PROPN, and it is quite difficult do debug the mapping- by- code. Is there any way where you could convert the generated PROPN, back into the PROPN file, just as if typed by hand? This would help a lot in diagnosing if the problem is lying from my mappings!
598;negative;I can not seem to figure out why the phpunit target does not output any test results even though I have tests in position. The problem I am finding is there is no indication as to what the problem is! Incredibly frustrating. The output is as follows: My build.xml is as follows: My system: PROPN, PROPN 5.2.9, PROPN 3.4, PHPUnderControl, PROPN
599;positive;([ 0- 1]?[ 0- 9]|2[0- 3]):([0- 5][0- 9]) I think that 's the regex you 're looking for( not specifically for javascript though). This site has an excellent amount of info for language- specific regular expressions! Cheers!
600;positive;<3 <3 <3!!! :)
601;negative;I am new to PROPN( been programming in it for about 6 months now). So far, it 's been an extremely frustrating experience, most of it coming from how bad PROPN is at handling dates and times. Maybe I think it 's bad because I do n't know how to use PROPN and PROPN properly, I do n't know. Here is what is happening on me right now: That 's not the exact code I use, everything is in variables and used in another context, but I think you can see the problem. Why is that calculation wrong? How am I suppose to work around this problem?
602;neutral;Any idea why this is called** PROPN* PROPN sampling?
603;neutral;Release candidate 1 is now available may be worth trying that.
604;negative;Either you want to group or you do n't. Now which is it?( This is why I really hate how PROPN allows non- aggregates in` PROPN PROPN`)
605;negative;I ca n't get to work a many- to- many relationship using bookshelf.js. Models: Database table" events": Database table" tags": Database table" events_tags": PROPN that is n't returning what it should: The log outputs: That is: empty array of tags, which is wrong. Question: Is there an issue with my code? the desired output should be: This does n't help in the question, but I 'll throw it anyway: I 'm currently hating all ORMs in PROPN PROPN! Maybe I should just use a query builder.

614;neutral;I want to call a method after each 2 minutes, how can I apply such logic?

617;neutral;given a youtube url, how can i embed the video into a page using .net c#?
618;negative;These will not jump: They are, however, soul destroying and extremely ugly.
619;positive;You DO need to modify web.xml whenever it 's needed. Especially with PROPN- PROPN, you will have to define your servlet in web.xml. I recommand you to use PROPN. There are plenty of exemple in the web to do so. Good luck, PROPN- PROPN is really great! PROPN is also nice.
620;negative;Yes, yes it is. It is really horrible though. There is also this atrocity:
621;positive;was excellent :) However instead of creating a button object, I am only calling an OnTouchlistener to change the state of every view. Gives the same results though
622;negative;No, I 'm afraid not! You can call yourself in a js- function from. codebehind:
623;neutral;Using the window object, only gives you access to globals, not to local variables.
624;neutral;I have a xml similar to this one: The thing is, I m able to get all the info tags, but I get the results from all dates. I do nt know what the dates will be, since the are dynamic generated. What I know is that I may have a data tag with one or two date tags I wish I could show the PROPN date PROPN   s info on a list box and the second date     s info on another listbox. How can I do that? Desirable Output: If there     s a second date then print it too: PROPN!

634;neutral;Is there any method to refresh state to begin and i can read png image using
635;positive;I absolutely* love* your title! But your question will need some more details if you need some help. Do you have any code you 've tried?

646;neutral;did you get the answer you were looking for?
647;positive;Thanks for the tips! Loving PROPN!
648;negative;Deleting files in PROPN does not delete them from installed apps/ build folders/ etc. It 's extremely annoying. If you really want your app to only run in 3.5 inch mode, delete the Default-568 file and make sure to run Clean/ PROPN PROPN PROPN in PROPN, and delete the app completely off your simulator/ device. It should start showing up letterboxed again. PROPN is still accepting 3.5 in only submissions.
649;negative;My approach to this problem would be: Create a that hosts a Add a dependency property to the. In the event handler, parse the PROPN and update the accordingly. Add a dependency property to the- and when this changes, parse the PROPN and add the data to the. See this question for a few pointers: By the way, a PROPN of column names is a horrible interface! Why not expose a, then add a so that you can use a CSV string in PROPN?

653;neutral;How to find a whose is and is?
654;neutral;Probably not, given they already have a checksum. Adding a second one is n't going to help all that much unless you 're really worried about edge cases which the PROPN checksum does n't pick up.
655;positive;Excellent summary!
656;negative;I do n't do c# anymore but yes I remember those templated stuff was really painful.
657;positive;* I really love your project, It is really amazing   Are you directly asking to BalusC?
658;negative;I 've set up PROPN to use constructor parameter names to map to a config file settings by convention. When a parameter is missing, it throws a very frightening: I want it to instead throw the following error: How can I do this?
659;neutral;I think your underscores got eaten by PROPN. You meant: 4.6.4.6.__class__.__name__
660;positive;So through an incredibly awesome coding session I managed to extract all the variables on the first try. Well, all checked out except for array since the PROPN I tested on did n't have one in the PROPN PROPN. All the data from PROPN are now in an PROPN, so its usable. Tomorrow I 'll be making the second part to put it back into the other type that is needed, CFDictionaryRef. So if you wanted to wait I 'll post it up.
661;positive;I 'm currently tuning a large app that uses PROPN using the following process( to great success!) PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN and create a trace using the' Tuning' template that gets saved to a file. Then interact with your app to exercise the slow spots. Stop the trace then start up the PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN. You can load up the trace file you just created and have it suggest all sort of optimizations. I 've just created 5 non- clustered indexes based on its suggestions and my app is easily 90% faster that it was before.
662;positive;Thanks @BrunoLowagie!( I 'm so thrilled to get your reply! If you write that as answer I would accept it!) I have found the relevant code samples:[ PROPN in PROPN, PROPN PROPN 16, PROPN sample](   and also[ How to recompress image in a PDF on PROPN PROPN PROPN 's website](   The first sample modifies a` PROPN` replacing virtually every` PROPN` key in an` PdfImageObject`, even passing in a byte array- bypassing image validation.

669;negative;I 'm working on PROPN web application and using from and as a web server. When i build the project, build complete successfully but when i start, the files that created during build in folder, getting to deleted!!
670;neutral;In my personal opinion, I would make theUILabels as properties of the PROPN, so option 2. You can then access them from the view easily through the controller. This also gives you the advantage of reusability from the view to any controller, and since dealloc will get rid of those from the PROPN, you only worry about cleanup once!
671;negative;The question on how to check input for validity is answered numerous times! You just check whether the stream is in a good state. If not, you 'll reset the stream and ignore the character. Search for question where this answered. Also, do n't use exceptions for non- exceptional cases and* always* throw something derived from` std::exception`: once you have tried to locate where an exception came from which is n't derived from` std::exception` in a program with a few million lines of code you 'll find it extremely helpful to look at what` what()` returns!

673;negative;Behaviour by tag, when you can just set a target action on a button directly? That 's horrible!
674;negative;Its not quick to do, but you can also run PROPN, and it will alert you to objects that are IDisposable that are nt in a using() block. Working on some legacy C# code here at work, I found that whoever wrote it orgininally actually made a" PROPN()" method is almost every class, even if not needed, but the classes do n't actually implement PROPN. Which means in intellisence they all have a PROPN() method, but ca n't be put in using() blocks ... very annoying!
675;positive;Ah, excellent!___
676;positive;Check out GSON for converting POJOs to JSON: We 've been using for a couple of years now. Very excellent library. For POJOs to XML, PROPN uses PROPN or you could roll your own serializer.
677;negative;ouch. I have a large table, and the row by row PROPN is very painful
678;neutral;What would the above be in PROPN?
679;positive;No worries, once you know, you know!
680;negative;( lack of line breaks in comments is saddening!)
681;neutral;How do i replace with using php
682;negative;I 've accidentally created a file called/ and one called --reporter= test and now I ca n't delete them, attempting to delete the --reporter file results in PROPN: illegal option --- I have n't attempted to delete the one called/ I 'm too scared, help!!
683;negative;No. I can not seem to be getting the module to work. Its really pain staking.
684;negative;yeah, your pain is mine! This method described by PROPN at least gives you some clue.
685;positive;At the moment my divs load in one by one on page load. It 's absolutely fine! Though when I make an ajax request and then to the same container my code then loops through all of the divs on the page rather than the newly added divs? My question is: how would I perform the same effect on only the newly added ajax success data? PROPN: HTML:
686;positive;I figured out, way of calling the Hub was not correct. For the time being i have modified my code as in Global.asax:- Works absolutely fine now :) Still figuring out better alternatives!!!!
687;positive;Excellent, thanks! That looks like an elegant solution.
688;positive;It 's works fine :) Thanks!
689;positive;Excellent example and interesting discussion! Thanks everyone!
690;neutral;If the user has n't checked anything there will be no$_ POST['features'] or$_ POST['fright'] You need to do an isset, or more precisely a! isset

692;positive;I have a series with many null values all over the place on the line. I need the gap between those values to be represented with a dotted- line or whatever( another color). Any help will be very welcome :) thanks!
693;negative;PROPN- I hate PROPN! PROPN is my final weapon.
694;positive;Hey I figured it out! I was n't using PROPN, PROPN, nor PROPN keywords effectively and I learned how to directly access the Font property of the progressbar control. I bet you guys figured all this out and was letting me think it through. Totally awesome! How did you guys get to be so smart? Well anyway, thanks for letting me learn from the best teacher of all. PROPN bless! PROPN.( Now, how do I close this question again?) ...
695;positive;Select the cells in question and do a find and replace ... Find. Replace/ I tested it and it worked perfectly :) Hope that helps!
696;negative;How can I get my PROPN, PROPN, PROPN, etc. tabs to go back to the bottom- middle of PROPN? For some reason, they moved up between the PROPN PROPN and the code editor in a vertical arrangement- I really hate it when sections of an PROPN break off and dock to some seemingly arbitrary area.
697;positive;That thing is really really awesome!
698;positive;Take a look at this, and rejoice! :)
699;negative;I 'm rethinking the design of my PROPN. I designed a few PROPN with PROPN automated PROPN( yes, I 'm lazy, and this generated code is often awful, I know!), but now I want them to be PROPN( actually, to inherit from another class that inherits PROPN). But I had the" setDefaultCloseOperation" modified, so my code is broken: setDefaultCloseOperation is impossible for a PROPN. Since I ca n't modify the generated code, I was wondering: is there a way to make PROPN understand I changed my mind, and regenerate the code?
700;negative;I have a PROPN to which I use to write characters into a PipedInputStream. Based on keyboard events. But I am implementing a backspace handler, but I can see no way of doing so without unputc. I am almost falling back into using a string to buffer the current line. Perhaps, I could do a better job using PROPN instead.( PROPN how I hate java!)
701;neutral;Take from:
702;negative;I really hate when this happens .. I search and search for an answer and then I post a question. Then minutes later I find the answer .. The answer was on line 5 .. this let me make the call .. I mean I get a pile of junk on the screen, but it does n't fail ... no exception.
703;positive;Hey I just had to solve this on a project I am working on, here is my answer Then in my configuration( I am using PROPN PROPN to configure my unit tests in code) PROPN!
704;positive;Excellent, I 'll check that out later, looks promising, thanks!
705;negative;does n't work. how do I do this?
706;positive;wonderful :-) :-)
707;negative;PROPN, the timer idea would result in horrible flickering for sure!
708;positive;PROPN PROPN- excellent- works perfectly! Thanx again :)
709;neutral;You never compile an .h file by itself, I think.
710;neutral;` CREATE TABLE[[ With Spiteful]]]([[ Identifiers]]] PROPN,[]] ^!^[] CHAR(10))`
711;negative;I 've been reading about PROPN design for a while now and it seems officially the PROPN calls objects and methods in the PROPN, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The PROPN should act and retrieve/ update objects inside the PROPN, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PROPN variables/ simple if statements should appear inside the PROPN. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the PROPN, surely there will be a lot of PROPN inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.
712;neutral;Is entity an instance of class?
713;positive;Excellent! it 's very useful to me!
714;positive;Let 's imagine something like this: Later I can do something like this: Is there any way I can set the limit when using the named query, and not when defining it? I 'd would really love to do something like: or PROPN in advance! :-)
715;positive;Excellent! Cheers dude
716;neutral;Is there a way to set which activity is to be started anytime the application is opened? Obviously I have the PROPN PROPN android.intent.action. PROPN and PROPN. PROPN, but I want it to reset to this activity even if the PROPN was n't completely killed( if it was n't, now it just goes back to the last activity that was open)
717;negative;This code is scary :(
718;negative;I have a big problem. I 've created site, using PROPN, but it runs very slowly. On mobile phones it 's terrible! And I do n't know, what 's wrong ... Someone can help me? Links does n't works yet, because I want use PROPN on this layout, but before I want to little optimise these scripts. Here 's test site: And here are the scripts:
719;neutral;Try this: If you really hate subqueries, you can use: But in this case Student table have to contain unique entries for one student entity.
720;negative;That 's very sad :(
721;neutral;You need to the file name as you build your URL. This will escape the'#' character, allowing the browser to interpret it appropriately. Proper encoding is very important for preventing attacks against your application, which can be devastating.
722;negative;Why do you not want to store it in the assets folder? That 's what it 's for. Regardless, you ca n't reference your local hard drive for it.( also, personal opinion, PROPN PROPN is a horrible, horrible font) EDIT: So I would add, you should be able to do it the way you 're doing it, you just ca n't use your local hard drive. Just get a reference to your PROPN as a, depending on where you are saving them( e.g.) and use.
723;neutral;is there a eval function in PROPN?
724;positive;PROPN mentioned PROPN(). It 's really great! Plz check this project PROPN() It 's a chat involving PROPN and PROPN. PROPN PROPN!
725;negative;JSPs must not include any code that requires dependency injection. So do n't do it. If you really must, you can use But this is extremely ugly.
726;neutral;list.pl PROPN is it possible?
727;neutral;Are both PROPN and the .NET in the same language?
728;neutral;Are you using this program in 64- bit linux?
729;neutral;See:
730;negative;What you are implementing here is very similar to a. Doing it by hand is the only way I 'm afraid! My advice is to use in your class A definition and override the properties for your class B implementation: Functionally, this will act similarly. The only downside is that your wrapped class A instance can no longer be changed independently of your class B instance. Is this a requirement?
731;negative;I hate PROPN- PROPN but because of a library, I have to use it!!! What 's the matter for PROPN- PROPN or are there errors in my code about using referance variable? Error: 9 C:***\main.c syntax error before PROPN&' token
732;negative;OK, I can continue to do web dev on my mac by sharing the webdev folder on my ubuntu laptop. This is a really terrible solution though.

737;negative;Is there a way to zoom extents of a collection of shapes without computing PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN 's and PROPN 's- very painful when sloping lines are involved. Perhaps some kind of pixel detection?
738;neutral;What version of PROPN is it?
739;positive;+1 pines is excellent!
740;negative;Is it to use the PROPN argument? As you already have seen that would be absolutely horrible. What I want to know is this: What is the recommended way to pass this sort of layout configuration to the partial view? By using a view model of course: and then: and then: and then: and then: and so on ...

742;negative;In my android app i 'm trying to share an Open PROPN including an object and an action. In my facebook app i added a story: and( is this ok?). When i try to add an image to the object in the OG i get above error. This is my code: here 's the logcat: What am i doing wrong? Maybe i 'm messing up some strings in the story, facebook tutorial is awful!
743;positive;I have found the from PROPN PROPN to just be that, Absolutely awesome! :). I have an on how to include it in PROPN PROPN and in PROPN, you could just pass it the generated form i d.
744;negative;I did n't find a solution. Thus, I delomboked the source code and done it with plain vanilla PROPN ... sad :-(
745;positive;Excellent, thanks!
746;negative;I have a datagridview and need of context menu. When i right- click on cell( PROPN PROPN)- context menu shows .. But in wrong place. Ca n't understand why here is the code: That stuff really annoys me!
747;neutral;Try to use the System. PROPN class.
748;positive;I saw questions about PROPN+ PROPN+ PROPN integration but none is clear or up to date with the current versions! Please if there is anyone who has a clear and simple example of the integration( form submit and saving in PROPN) I will be extremely thankful! If you could put the simple project in a PROPN and upload it( with its jars it will be great) Thank you!
749;neutral;How large is the file? Can it fit in memory?
750;negative;Not sure this answers the question accurately, what does everyone else think?
751;neutral;Could you rewrite the question to reflect that?
752;negative;Error handling in classic ASP is a complete pain. You can catch the error where you think it 's going to occur using, then check for the error code in the following line of code. Alternately you can scan the server logs for 500 errors. or set up a" 500 error" page in your PROPN settings.
753;negative;whatever generated this code is terribly broken!
754;neutral;what 's the difference between?
755;neutral;I think you 'd be better off with PROPN.

I 'm thinking here about the PROPN PROPN field in particular. Additionally, could anyone point me to the documentation which specifies this?
761;neutral;+1 simple is PROPN l   gant.
762;positive;can do it! And you can find other plugins on the. Note that you can not use this plugin with PROPN pages. This video is excellent!
763;negative;Here 's a really terrible hack if you do n't want the indirection and do n't mind doing the cleanup yourself:
764;positive;I have imported the data into an database. PROPN, PROPN, PROPN, pt_loc) Now, I want to find which of these a primary( have unique) values. Any way I could found is would return the same value Any input would be great :) Thanks!!!
765;positive;@MattBurland no worries!
766;positive;PROPN: Excellent! Now I understand what is going on, rather than just thrashing, as before. I think your explanation( about the canvas ignoring` refresh- now` before it is open) is very sensible.( If any Racket developers are listening here, it seems a valuable tool would be a way to pause until the frame is ready for action, platform- independent.)
767;positive;I 'm in PROPN using PROPN. Something is just wrong with the PROPN management of PROPN- it keeps resizing on me! ... It usually happens when I either switch tabs or split the window or switch between splits. Any help would be completely awesome! Thanks!
768;negative;I am have used the remove data method to remove validation from the page. This works but throws an error in the console window and crashes with PROPN( I 'm being forced to develop to this browser ... sad I know!). Does anyone know how I can stop this error? Here is my code to remove the validator: Here is the error message from the console:
769;positive;There is a such thing as a[ sublime- project](   file which you could check into PROPN control, but it seems like it could be overridden by PROPN specific settings per the[ settings PROPN](   and people would likely have to use the project file to get the benefit.[ This blog](   is also interesting and applicable.
770;neutral;Which version of the PROPN core are you using?
771;neutral;that 's what I thought, that 's why I 'm surprised
772;negative;Just had this happen to me .. very annoying! I am using" PROPN PROPN" to try and restore the files, because I have no other backup.
773;negative;` PROPN logger PROPN new PROPN`- I 'd be more worried about the impending logpocalypse!
774;positive;Yes, it 's possible, juste remove the second parameter of your method( it 's totally useless) PROPN it will work( I tested the code)!
775;negative;Doubles are n't compared that way in real life ...
776;neutral;Never hardcode urls. Always use url helpers when dealing with urls:
777;positive;I 'm using PROPN and am trying to come up with a way to use an abbreviated field name. I want to keep the keys as plain english but have the field names stored short( e.g." name" maps to" PROPN n"). I noticed a conversation but it ended up closed() and I was wondering if anybody has an example of how to accomplish this. I 'd be extremely grateful for any feedback!
778;negative;Ohh, well this is sad! I found the error and it unfortunately just was a typographical error ...
779;neutral;
780;negative;I ran into the same thing a few years ago with a PROPN system, so I do feel your pain!
781;positive;I found the answer! It appears to be an issue with sending to the development device tokens. Like most people, we have a database that stores the device tokens, and the earlier records were populated with our device tokens from testing. As soon as I net out those device tokens from my list, all works! I really hope someone finds this useful!
782;negative;This one does not: Why is that?
783;positive;That 's super great! @JoshuaNozzi Thanks!!!
784;neutral;See related:
785;positive;Theoretically if you wrap the functions of each file in a separate class then you can call them both without problems. You do n't even need to really worry about class state if you call them statically.
786;positive;Sure, you can. Just mark your content with the appropriate langauge code: if you use the following PROPN, the spanish text is formatted with the most- loved font style comic sans PROPN: PROPN!
787;positive;Excellent!, thanks for remembering :)
788;negative;my experience with PROPN is not good ): and PROPN least in PROPN) is extremely poor!
789;negative;In my case sometimes begins work after" PROPN PROPN/ PROPN". Actually, its terrible bug, you have no guarantees that you see actual list!!!

795;positive;Absolutely Beautiful!
796;positive;Excellent! That is what I 'm looking for! Thanks very much!
797;positive;PROPN PROPN! This, together with PROPN PROPN 's advice helped us track it down.
798;negative;@Martinho: Indeed. But you have to learn an awful lot of PROPN to understand PROPN type traits do, and what the corresponding syntax means!
799;neutral;PROPN is your thingy dawg
800;neutral;for completness:
801;positive;I think PROPN is what best suited for your requirement. this is the link go and download and attach this library to your project. I used this and it works very beautifully ..!
802;neutral;Where is the func module? Is there any docs in PROPN?
803;positive;Pretty self explanatory question. I just do n't know how to do it. I 've been using PROPN for about a month so I still have a lot to learn. I 'm using the newest version of eclipse PROPN and need to push the app( or email it) to my MyTouch. How would I do it from eclipse, as that is the way I would prefer? If I should just email it, would I email the whole project folder or just a particular piece of code? I thank you for all your help in advance. This site has been so incredibly helpful!

809;negative;I have spent days trying to find any information or working samples on how I can get PROPN data such as emails in my gmail inbox, list of my contacts, my calendar events etc ... None whatsoever :( There are broken pieces of some code fragments here and there, 90% say it 's been deprecated, is the a one single page on the internet that gives me a working example how to do that from javascript. Many pages about PROPN, but I have absolutely no idea how to use it, I have spent days reading broken pieces here and there, but I was unable to understand what that it and how I can use it PROPN. Very sad, and I am very tired to waste so much time on things that do nt work and are not documented in human language, possible to understand. Why do they have to overcomplicate thing so much and spread broken pieces of information everywhere?
810;neutral;What languages do you work in? Is there a specific PROPN PROPN you recommend?
811;neutral;Use a real PROPN instead of reference counting.
812;neutral;@Stultuske Depends on the context. I would totally abuse a library.
813;neutral;-1 undefined behavior
814;neutral;With an you would get different results for and, but that class is clearly documented as violating the general contract of maps: This class is not a general- purpose PROPN implementation! While this class implements the PROPN interface, it intentionally violates PROPN 's general contract, which mandates the use of the equals method when comparing objects. This class is designed for use only in the rare cases wherein reference- equality semantics are required. For normal PROPN implementations there is no problem with using string keys.
815;neutral;I think this question belongs to ServerFault.com
816;negative;I really hate to give any pointers without explanation but i think your requirements are bigger::: so --->
817;negative;Absolutely terrible!!! It is not PROPN PROPN
818;negative;Indexed lookups in PROPN are PROPN). That 'd could be terrible for a 3d array!

820;positive;I have an old friend who is a mathematician. He has his own math to compress his formulas, which are incredibly beautiful. He works in a program called PROPN, which transforms the formulas for 3D- shapes. I wonder if it is possible to obtain these figures using PROPN and PROPN? See attached formula and figure. I know little of this myself. But I would be delighted if some one could show me an example.
821;neutral;how to do this in codeigniter?
822;positive;i work with PROPN 2007( excell) in my C# program. i do this reference: it work excellent!, but if in the computer there is PROPN 2003 is it work good? if not, what i need to do? thank 's in advance
823;negative;The problem is that you never run the method, so the field stays at zero. It 's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name.
824;negative;So I am using the android PROPN to try and hit a PROPN script every 3 minutes .... it 's going to check if a notification needs to be sent to the user. I keep getting a nullpointer exception, and what s more weird is ... whenever I run another PROPN or PROPN request, the alarm fires off as well( even though its set to ONLY every 3 minutes ...) Here is my code for the alarm( AlarmReceiver ): here is my code to set the alarm( on PROPN ):
825;positive;Is it possible to re- open an .xcarchive file on PROPN? I know this is not common, but I would like to open a project exactly as it was submitted to the PROPN PROPN. I do n't have back up of that exact build, so it would be really great to open the archive copy! Before you ask why do n't I just download it from the store, I must say this build has been approved and is just pending on my release. :) Thanks!
826;positive;Excellent! Thanks :)
827;positive;If you are really worried about performance, PROPN is PROPN). Your second query is only going to execute if the first is null. You could try using .Any(predicate). First() lends itself to try{} catch which might be better for your situation. You do n't really need to worry about performance optimization until it becomes an issue, though.
828;positive;Wow, great site, and people I got in an answer in less then 5 minutes! Thanks PROPN!
829;negative;Your formatting is absolutely horrible to read. Could you fix that?
830;positive;Excellent, exactly what I needed!
831;negative;I ca n't believe one of those PROPN haters has n't posted a comment about how parsing HTML with PROPN contributes to the rise of PROPN!
832;negative;I am getting very strange flickering on a WPF application of mine. It only happens with alpha blended content, only on my computer, and only with PROPN applications. At least I have n't noticed it with anything else. It 's really annoying! Has anyone else dealt with this weirdness?
833;negative;I am using PROPN PROPN 11. Something annoying keeps happening when I add code to my site through the PROPN form that I use. Take this line: Let 's say I want to copy just this in PROPN, through the form on the page: When I go to copy just that section, it actually copies this: It is VERY annoying! It does n't happen on PROPN or PROPN. For reasons with the PROPN I have to use Internet PROPN. Is there a setting I can change so that does n't happen? On PROPN 7 if that helps. Sorry if this does n't 100% fit with programming, someone let me know if there is a better place for this question.
834;neutral;Any reason for not using PROPN?
835;positive;:D :D :D :D :D :D
836;neutral;Here it is:
837;negative;Netbeans is showing all files and folders under PROPN/ PROPN/ application/ app/ webroot/ as ignored, but that is not what is in the .gitignore file. Any ideas? This is incredibly annoying. PROPN version PROPN PROPN version 7.2.1( PROPN 201210100934) Here is the PROPN file:
838;neutral;One example is if you provide a custom in. Obviously calling wrong will likely produce devastating results.
839;neutral;Has PROPN analog of enum in PROPN?
840;neutral;What does PROPN in PROPN stand for?
841;negative;This should do it( it 's not quite a one- liner I 'm afraid ):
842;negative;I am sorry for posting so many questions, but getting this to work has been incredibly painful, even PROPN PROPN makes it much easier I figure this has got to do with my PROPN PROPN PROPN. I am using my distribution profile across all my settings. My app has been configured to both development and production. What could the causes of this error be? As a side note, i have been working on this for the entire day, and i get stuck at one thing after the other, esp involving static libraries and PROPN. Am I really bad at this, or does PROPN really make it so hard?
843;neutral;Is it possible( or desirable?!) to set up to behave more like? For example, instead of writing why ca n't I just write Similarly, instead of why not just
844;neutral;PROPN Please read[ The PROPN PROPN Every PROPN PROPN Absolutely, Positively Must Know About PROPN and PROPN PROPN( PROPN PROPN!)](   PROPN is not a character encoding and not concerned with bytes, though as a matter of fact you can not fit all unicode code points into 16 bit because there are more than 2^ 16 of them.
845;negative;@Bukes: That 's disgraceful :(
846;neutral;Clients deliver us files that big that we have to parse through.
847;negative;What an awful PROPN!
848;negative;We in the process of building an PROPN app( it 's yet to be launched). We are trying to implement PROPN PROPN as part of the build. We have set this up via PROPN PROPN and have created and registered an app certificate for the app which contains push notification permissions. Basically we send the app message from PROPN code- it states that it has been published and it returns the message PROPN but the device does n't receive anything. To clarify the device registers ok for remote notifications and returns a device token. Very frustrating! Does anyone have any tips?
849;positive;is really awesome!
850;positive;Thanks for the excellent link!
851;neutral;Try this and it should test PROPN 's thought ... Or possibly this ...
852;negative;I agree, we often face this problem when using 10 PROPN PROPN databases, this is really annoying!
853;negative;When I refactor the following line: using PROPN 's" PROPN PROPN PROPN", I get the following: I really hate this type of formatting because with longer object names and variables it just gets out of control. How can I get PROPN to do the following?
854;negative;I really hate putting variables in the view. I would change your helper to to" memoize" it, and just keep the three function calls.
855;positive;PROPN, PROPN, and others all require the images to be the same width and height. I need a slider that will allow me to have images with varying widths. has a good example, but it only works if you have the slider take up the full width of the screen. Any direction would be greatly greatly appreciated!
856;neutral;What breaks when you use 1.6?
857;positive;I 've just stumbled onto this one there you will find a couple of PROPN PROPN templates!!!
858;positive;You can do it with PROPN, you should look into PROPN, an excellent PROPN library which makes it really easy to do that plus a PROPN more! It 's worth the small learning curve, trust me.
859;negative;that what i was afraid of! cause my knowledge about ajax is zero :(
860;positive;I see ... that 's really great! Thanks!
861;negative;I 'm sorry, but I did n't had an eye on this thread. I 'm afraid the topic is n't hot anymore

864;positive;You should definitely check out PROPN PROPN 's three- part series on .NET 2.0 configuration up on PROPN. Highly recommended, well written and extremely helpful! He shows how to create and use custom configuration sections, and goes on to explain how to use your own custom.config instead of or in addition to PROPN .NET PROPN files. PROPN
865;negative;I just got through this exact problem. What a pain! If you are running a 32- bit PROPN on a 64- bit Windows, make sure that you set the execution policy for the 32- bit Powershell interface. I found my 32 bit executable here: The PROPN and 64- bit Powershell environments are completely distinct so setting the execution policy in one has no effect on the other.

869;negative;is not an, it 's a basic type. You can only add NSObject- derived objects to an NSArray. The EXC_BAD_ACCESS is probably because, under the covers, it 's trying to access an object stored at wherever your int is pointing to. In other words, it 's using your int as a pointer to an NSObject and failing horribly when it does so.
870;positive;Hey PROPN, I saw you posting a lot of` git` questions tonight( which is completely fine!) but just wanted to make sure you were aware of    and the PROPN PROPN PROPN:    which might help you with some of your questions. The community book even has some screencasts in it. Again, feel free to ask questions here ... just wanted to pass that along to you.
871;negative;PROPN, the stack trace under that is just my function name. Nothing more. very frustrating :(
872;positive;@ajreal no worries, I think I managed to fix it!
873;neutral;PROPN, which auto- generated headers are these?
874;negative;The answer does not establish the same 's as adding directly to the ajax call. So in order for PROPN to do this properly I add this: where is a global variable. Unfortunately, I have to write this extra line on every single ajax call. Terrible! Maybe I 'll edit the PROPN framework to handle this ..
875;positive;The following will mirror your dev DB up to production on heroku: PROPN rake PROPN: push but what you probably really PROPN) to do was run the migration PROPN rake PROPN: migrate Good luck!
876;neutral;To get it to work in Internet PROPN I had to use following code:
877;negative;I 've searched this and can not find it. I 've tried different plugins and different browsers( PROPN, PROPN, and PROPN). I 've tried most of the no flash plugins for each of those as well as disabling PROPN plugins/ addons in the settings. I also renamed the file in i found by searching the system. when i renamed it, makes PROPN and PROPN ask to install PROPN, but still: returns: I 'm not sure what else to try without uninstalling PROPN, but that will be a total pain in the ass for this. I also PROPN do n't want to use PROPN just to see if PROPN is at all installed which I can do simply with: Any ideas?
878;negative;I am trying to generate API documentation via cabal and haddock. I want it to be latex. So I do: This fails ultimately with: Is there something I can do or is something wrong with haddock? PROPN, I have to use cabal since the build process is rather complicated( lots of preprocessors, ffi libraries, ...). Invoking haddock manually is really painful. Building PROPN documentation however is working completely as expected. The complete output is at. I am using:
879;positive;I have a script that prints out the average time when pinging a server, shown below: How can I add the line number to output of the script above when pinging a list of servers?? my actual output when pinging list of 3 host is: I want the output to be like this: so that this can be read by PROPN :) Thank in advanced!!
880;positive;Is there a way to convert a ui formed with PROPN to a python version to use without having an extra file? I 'm using PROPN for this UI, and converting this PROPN file to a readable python version to implement would be really great!
881;positive;Excellent, thanks!
882;negative;@sjdowling when downvoting someone you are suggested to explain why ...
883;negative;When you call" PROPN" you 're creating a new process that runs that command, so after running exec("su") you have a new process with SU rights. You ca n't give your already running application SU rights I 'm afraid! I 'm not sure how other applications do this, but you can run" PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN" and then read from the outputstream of the process.
884;positive;excellent, thanks!
885;neutral;This is an exact repost of a previous question.
886;positive;As was noted in the comments the link is: He particularly piqued my interest with this quote:" ... in certain cases, you are simply better off working on getting more data, then spending your time on improving the PROPN ..." Excellent presentation and presenter()! Highly recommended for anyone wanting to start down the path of machine learning.
887;positive;I use following code for displaying three simple rollover images over one main background image. The code works absolutely fine with PROPN, but unluckily not with PROPN! I hope, somebody might have an idea to improve my lines! Thank you already very much!
888;positive;wow this is really awesome! thanks for that @petert
889;positive;Excellent thank you guys!
890;positive;I 'd recommend python as a fantastic general- purpose scripting language which is fairly quick to pick up. You 'll find it 's more versatile for system- programming than something like php, which would be another option. You might look here as a starting point: Besides, if you learn python, you can then learn django, which is incredibly awesome!
891;positive;I 've done much searching on this and ca n't seem to find an example that helps my case. I have an array like so: What I am trying to achieve is a new array with grouping like the following: Any pointers would me hugely appreciated!
892;neutral;This did n't work for me, just to confirm the port number that needs changing is 1374?
893;negative;been looking at this for days ..
894;positive;Is there any need any more to profile with PROPN now that we can use PROPN( which incidentally is absolutely fantastic and really speeds up development!)
895;positive;No. Just size permgen appropriately. It 's no different to having to size the heap appropriately. Do n't be afraid!
896;positive;I have an xml document that is generated based on what the parametres are in the URL for example: This will generate an xml page. Now I want to display this in a formatted way on the menu, after having a look it seems that: file_get_contents() seems to be the best option. But I was just wondering how I can place elements and attributes found in this xml into the PROPN PROPN? Any tips/ help would be hugely appreciated!
897;negative;Well asp.net is problematic by itself in many ways. I can only imagine how the page is coded, but mostly asp.net submits are done in a very painful way through_ doPostback where it sets additional hidden fields. You might want to try reading this and reviewing the generated html of the page
898;neutral;Seems that it has moved to PROPN:
899;positive;PROPN has which is pretty excellent.
900;negative;I have a function: Basically it just uses the plugin to nudge an image on mouseover to one slide and then another, to give the effect of a shake. I can see my code looks absolutely horrible,( I come from a php/ c# background) can anoyone suggest a better means to achieve my goal?
901;positive;I am Posting my values from database here, code:?> Then I am trying to write out all rows of my array but ca n't get to understand how. However, this is the code from my script. Hope you can help somehow. Thanks. I ca n't find a solution so I am very greatful for good and simple answers!
902;negative;No, and I would be very afraid if there was.
903;neutral;What was it you had to change to get it working?
904;positive;@Stephen excellent example! Somehow my mind was stuck in 1995 :)
905;positive;Have a look at.( Except for it being the foundation of their incredibly great PROPN product, I have n't used it, though.)

915;negative;I 'm trying to run a PROPN command in PROPN that requires admin access. I have figured out a way using runas, but it opens a PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN- Up, which almost defeats the purpose of the automation and is really annoying! Is there any way around this? Here 's my code for the PROPN command:
916;positive;I created a Mastermind code and when I attempt to run it on my PROPN it just says" logout". If anyone knows why, that would be extremely helpful! Here is the code:
917;positive;This is very fine :) Note that if you do the following: Only the first element of the array will be initialized with the non- zero number whereas the rest will be initialized with zeros.
918;neutral;Maybe you can use the to do this.
919;negative;PROPN() is not accurate enough.
920;positive;Excellent! Onward with your project ...
921;positive;@KDJ It means the elements siblings whose PROPN 's end in PROPN PROPN, and no worries!
922;negative;This is extremely unsafe! Use` mysqli` or` pdo` instead of` mysql_`.
923;neutral;how can we read http port in c#
924;neutral;PROPN memory can be garbage collected by full collections, so increasing it may increase the amount of PROPN time when a full collection takes place. These collections should n't take place too often though, and would typically still take less than a second to full PROPN 1 PROPN of permgen memory- I 'm just pulling this number from( my somewhat hazy) memory, so if you are really worried about PROPN times to some timing tests yourself( use and read the logs, more details)
925;positive;I have a hidden UIpickerView that should display a different Array depending on what button is pushed. The picker view shows up when the button is pushed but for some reason it does n't show the PROPN in the picker view. I would be extremely grateful of any help!!!! Here is the .m file: Many Thanks
926;negative;That is incredibly frustrating!
927;positive;excellent answer!! Its very informative. Thank you.
928;neutral;ok i have tried this with PROPN but not with great success! any tools suggestions?
929;negative;The following code to use results in black image no capture, why? Note that adding before capture has no effect! Googling has been completely useless for this case, so far!

931;negative;I absolutely hate that this exists, but there it is:
932;negative;Believe me without an PROPN you just waste your time and it is a real pain! if you feel that visual studio is expensive you can try the or go for or
933;negative;@Pieter       He 's worried about the performance of PROPN and you 're suggesting PROPN?!
934;positive;PROPN PROPN!
935;positive;No worries, PROPN!
936;neutral;Having had some experience with using a thick client through PROPN, I 'd say go with some kind of web app. If done wrong, a thick client can become really painful to use through a VPN because of data churning. A web app concentrates all of that on the server, which makes it much better from that point of view. Other benefits: no deployment hassle no direct access to the database from the user machine. Evidently it also depends on your skills, and on how much time/ budget you have ...
937;neutral;Maybe do a setTimeout for the length of the video and fire an event once the length of the video has passed. Try this to detect when the window loses focus: If you 're really worried about the accuracy of PROPN, maybe try this:
938;positive;in my database I have these two tables( Project and PROPN). I also have a middle table called PROPN which contains PROPN and PROPN. In Theme there are about 15 values pre- setted. I am able to display all these themes into checkboxes however I do n't know how to save them in my database. Here is my controller: Here is my model: And my second model: Finally here is my create view: So please if there is anyone that could help me, It would be really great :)
939;positive;As things are evolving very fast, there are some major update. For example, a framework named PROPN has made much work to make Angular.js work in hand with PROPN. Please have a look at their web site and at the 6(!) example they provide on how to use it:. Pretty amazing! Hope that helps! Note: I have no affiliation with PROPN at all.
940;positive;Hi Derick- right now, I 'm running from the command line, and very soon we 'll have it hooked up to hudson. We 've convinced people that hudson will be fine without a physical log file from the rake execution. And I think I 've satiated the desire for log files by using the" .parameters" option on my msbuild and nunit tasks to log output. I 'm LOVING albacore! You guys did a great job with it.
941;negative;This in an extremely ignorant answer.

953;neutral;What are PROPN coordinates of?
954;negative;I have an application where I need to adjust view position according to current focused subview( it 's a list with focusable items, current focused item must be in the center of the screen- used for a tv application controlled from PROPN remote). Position must be adjusted with animation. I got it working with just one problem: if the user changes focus before the animation is complete( quickly taps" up" button twice) next animation starts with" jump"- it starts from the same position as did the first one. So what I try to do is I cancel previous animation and start another, but then new animation starts from the point where first animation was started, so user can see a very obvious jumps in the animation, which look really awful. Here 's the code: So must question is: how can I start translate animation from the point where previous translate animation left on( assuming that it was cancelled)? Or, in a simplier words, how can I determine current visible rect of a view?
955;negative;I have a serious problem which I ca n't a solution to. I need to authenticate a token in order to let the user login into my app, the problem is that even though I 'm using the PROPN, and probably because of it, I ca n't authenticate it in time. Other problem that sometimes accurs is that I get the NetworkOnMainThreadException error ... I 'm really hopeless. Here 's the flow- And here 's my code- That 's is the PROPN class-
956;neutral;No PROPN is one of PROPN 's competitors.
957;positive;This might work for what I have in mind, will certainly give it a try.
958;positive;@Brant- No worries!
959;positive;if your memory consideration is only about these integers, then all I say is PROPN PROPN
960;negative;Android apps are constrained to a certain amount of memory. As it 's quite( insanely?) low, I think you should n't feel guilty about using all of it! The limit is 16 MB on very old devices, 24 MB or 32 MB on newer ones. There does n't seem to be much info on the size for different devices, and nobody seems to know why the limit is so small when modern phones have 1- 2 PROPN of PROPN. PROPN, I found some concrete numbers on the limit: PROPN: 16 MB Droid: 24 MB PROPN One: 32 MB Xoom: 48 MB
961;negative;@Milhous* Everything breaks when you use PROPN*.

971;negative;Horrible but linqy!
972;positive;Use the. It has a PROPN PROPN for exactly that, and I like it, even if tabs are all the hype now. I already used it with great success!
973;negative;This makes me really sad.
974;neutral;What 's the PROPN way to do this?
975;neutral;You actually linked to the same article twice there- did you mean to?
976;positive;Hi PROPN, I think PROPN 's answer is pretty pretty more powerful than my comment!
977;positive;excellent, good luck!

982;neutral;Is PROPN PROPN PROPN the proprietary version of BlazeDS?
983;positive;No worries, I have definitely done that before while copying a url from PROPN!
984;positive;@GUI PROPN, I 'll keep you informed.
985;negative;This was one area of PROPN that the designers got terribly badly wrong!
986;negative;indeed, I HATE IT! But sadly no, i could not find an alternative ... Sorry :(
987;negative;I 'm using PROPN with PROPN. When I 'm making a completion, the current window is splitted and calltips are shown in the upper pane. I hate that! Is there a way to prevent that behavior or at least limit the size of the upper pane automaticly?

997;positive;PROPN: a* very* excellent question. There 's not typically a good reason to do so.
998;positive;Excellent, thanks very much! Moving them to inst/ tests and running test() worked.

1005;neutral;Another option you have is to override PROPN() on the first screen of your app, so it will be called right before your process gets killed!
1006;neutral;@Pangea it 's* PROPN*
1007;positive;@Styxxy, It looks like the PROPN is explicitly designed for PROPN PROPN 's and/or does n't support modifying PROPN values, and the process for tracking registry values does n't seem to apply to many of the Local PROPN 's that can be modified in the gpedit.msc interface( procmon shows no registry changes while making the change). Example: 2012SP1:" Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security PROPN PROPN PROPN Assignment\Perform volume maintenance tasks" add/ remove PROPN to the list. If you or anyone can provide some assistance that would be extremely helpful! Thanks!

1028;negative;I am having trouble with adding text to the RichTextBox with tabs in it. I have code similar to this: And when I do this I can see tabs in paragraphs that start with' \t' but if I actually delete the tab then press the PROPN key, the indentation is wrong. In fact it 's about half the size exactly. Also if I tab in the middle of a line the tabbing is different. Also when I pull the Text out of the PROPN lines that start with tabs appear to not generate' PROPN 's generated by pressing the PROPN key. This is incredibly frustrating. Does anyone have advice or ideas how to work with this?
1029;positive;I 'm building a little framework with PROPN, and I would try to use data from an API but I do n't know why it does n't work( asynchronous but??). Some advices could be very great! By the way, I tried with xmlhttprequest too. Thanks for your help!

1046;positive;I have a table with a field that needs to store 512 characters. My question is this: can you limit the length of a TEXT field( PROPN stops at 255- I ca n't use it) to 512 characters? If I do that, will MySQL run through the table quicker due to the fixed data length, or does it act a bit like PROPN in that the length can vary? I do n't have a table( at all) yet, but I 'm very conscious about speed and size for the future. I found this article: incredibly useful- maybe you will to! Thanks a lot, PROPN
1047;negative;I HATE PROPN!!!
1048;negative;Unfortunately the PROPN PROPN is not unique on all systems. It should be but it is n't. This is not because of a failure in the specification of the PROPN PROPN, but is due to the fact that many manufacturers do n't follow the spec when creating this UUID. For more information about how this goes wrong in practice see this PROPN blog and the following instructive tale has some really awful examples from the real world:. By the way there is another more informative topic on stackoverflow about creating machine unique PROPN PROPN 's at

1064;negative;strange error. One of which i can not find any existing resources to solve the issue. The issue is, when using I get pointed to a folder at" PROPN PROPN( PROPN PROPN PROPN". Naturally, this breaks everything which depends on the correct folder( the one my solution is actually in) being given. What is more strange is that there exists a unit- test to make sure that this path at least has the correct root folder and sometimes it will pass and will be working as expected, and then the very next debug, will point to the aforementioned folder again. Very confusing and very annoying! Any ideas?

1081;negative;How do I change the position of the sort button in header of the grid in PROPN 5? I have column names of different lengths and I break lines on spaces, so the button, which is appended to the end of the column names, always ends up in different height. And that is very ugly :(
1082;negative;So only workaround which works for me is to add this PROPN to template of my site .. But its really awful solution, since I only need it in one article/ module

1093;negative;For PROPN PROPN 2005, I ALWAYS had to install the full product first, then PROPN second.

1099;positive;excellent- thanks guys!
1100;positive;We added this snippet to PROPN, with great success: Thanks!
1101;neutral;If I start a process with PROPN(), how can I later terminate that process, with say pressing/ sending the" q" key. Instead of using, you could look at using, which requires that you pass in an array specifying three -- one for, one for and one for. This will let you easily feed input into the program while processing output, without blocking just waiting for it to execute. You can later use to viciously murder it, if needed.
1102;negative;Is there any way to quickly jump to a scene in a storyboard? I have about 30 different scenes/ view controllers and it has become incredibly tedious to locate the view controller I 'm trying to edit.
1103;negative;So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one. I think the example below solved the problem( or at least gives an idea of how to solve it ): The extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped.

1108;positive;@ecu- Excellent :) I added an answer so future googlers can find the answer a bit easier, it seems comments are n't looked at nearly as often when scanning for the reason.

1110;neutral;Was C# compiler written in PROPN?
1111;negative;there is no PROPN work on my computer just devc++ and turboc and the two is too bad i want PROPN express or netBean c++ but nothing work! i do n't know why but i hate this situation it 's too bad! :(
1112;negative;You could implement it using` goto` 's( the horror!)
1113;negative;We are running PROPN on a server that does not have internet access( even through proxy). Installing and keeping the PROPN installation up- to- date is a pain! My idea was to make a local mirror of the complete PROPN public update- site through a PROPN workstation that has internet access. And then make this local mirror available to PROPN through PROPN share. So my questions: How to make the local mirror? Do you have a better/ simpler idea to keep the PROPN installation up- to- date?
1114;positive;So this could be hard to explain but i want to do a for ...:= 1 to 10 do statement but i want it to be for PROPN to PROPN do. The main purpose of this excersise is to load data into a string grid. So lets have it load the cells 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 with the PROPN PROPN, PROPN, PROPN, PROPN, PROPN all the way up to 14. If anyone knows how to do this i would be extremely thankful!

1117;neutral;When we have a cluster of machines behind a load balancer( PROPN), generally hardware load balancer have persistent connections, Now when we need to deploy some update on all machines( rolling update), the way to do is by bringing one machine Out of rotation, looks for no request sent to that server via lb. When the app reached no request state then update manually. With 70- 80 servers in picture this becomes very painful. Can someone have a better way of doing it.

1179;negative;Getting the ssrs add- in to install properly was a complete pain. I think it had to do with the fact that we did development on the server prior to installing the ssrs add- in.

1181;negative;We 're running into a really painful issue with PROPN 's here, and I was wondering if anyone else has found a solution. The problem itself is quite simple: We frequently trigger background tasks in PROPN or, since most of our screens must display data loaded from a Web service. While these tasks are running, we show the PROPN 's refresh spinner and animate it. The problem is: onCreate and PROPN are executed before is, so at the point where we start the task, the refresh spinner does n't even exist. Hence, it wo n't animate. I do n't see any simple way around this. I guess we could keep the information about a task being spawned in PROPN, and as soon as the PROPN becomes available, update it accordingly. But still, I ca n't believe a use case as common as this is so difficult to do with PROPN?

1237;positive;Excellent resource, thank you!!
1238;positive;In my PROPN app( C#) I have a circle( defined by a) that I am presently filling with a solid color. I would like to fill this with a circular( not linear) gradient( so one color in the center fades to another color uniformly around the edges). I have experimented with, but am having no luck( I still see a solid color). If anyone has any sample code that does this, that would be terrific!
1239;positive;I created a mobile application with the yeoman mobile- generator. PROPN very new to grunt and yeoman, but it 's really awesome stuff! Does anyone know what I have to do add a banner to my generated files? Where I have to use this. I have tried something like this, but does not affect. ...
1240;neutral;No you ca n't do that. PROPN does n't know how to handle PROPN scripts.
1241;negative;I 'm calling onto some code that returns me an PROPN response. I can get the contents of the response which returns me a byte array. The bytes represent a zip file that I would like to extract and get the contents of a single file( the zip only contains one file). Currently I have some messy code( I 'll need to clean it up if I keep it) that seems to work: but was wondering whether there was a cleaner way to do the same thing because the above looks incredibly ugly.
1242;neutral;PROPN, No worries- You were basically there!
1243;neutral;Personally, just because you can does n't mean you should.
1244;negative;I 'm trying to debug my application and from the point I fire it up on the PROPN, it will get killed by timeout before it ever reaches PROPN()( I have abreakpoint there)! Here' swhat I see in the output panel. All this takes almost 20s. If I run the app in PROPN build it randomly gets stuck. I hit a button and the delegate gets caled half a minute later. What is going on? In the PROPN it is all okay.
1245;neutral;You can just store it in a variable if it 's scoped to each element:
1246;positive;I have two files. File 1: a PROPN file with gene sequences, formated like this example: File 2: A simple text file with JUST the accession identification of the gene. Like so. Every entry in PROPN 2 is somewhere in PROPN 1, but not every entry in PROPN 1 is in PROPN 2. I need to remove all the entries from PROPN 1 that are not in PROPN 2. I feel like there must be something in the PROPN module that could help me, I just do n't know what. For instance, I originally thought that I could extract just the accessions from my PROPN file using the function, but this really just lands me with two files of accession numbers. I do n't know how to selectively extract the accessions that are in the other file. Maybe like reading all the entries from PROPN 2 into a dictionary and then associated that entry with its matching entry in PROPN 1 and use to extract the whole sequence ... But I really do n't know .... Any help anyone could give me is extremely appreciated!

1252;negative;I have been trying to use PROPN and the PROPN analyzer in chrome with a script processor but I am running into the same issue that this person has: In that SO answer, someone pointed out this bug report: but it is over a year old! My questions are: does anyone know if this will be fixed anytime soon and should I file a bug elsewhere? Is that bug report( that is a year old) still being looked at? Or better yet, maybe someone knows a workaround? My code is essentially the same as the PROPN on that PROPN link. It 's really sad that this stuff does n't work in chrome but it does in PROPN.

1254;neutral;as of 1.6.0_29 this one is the only one that worked for me

1256;positive;I want to find out how long time there is till a specific from. I have searched everywhere, but ca n't really find anything.

It 's confusing( probably why you got it wrong( it should have been)) and you can just use the equality operator:, which is well- defined for( in case you were worried about the whole," Do n't compare using equality!" thing). But what you really should do is store the data in a map keyed on username and do a direct lookup:
1261;positive;Great, excellent links. Thanks for the help!
1262;negative;I guess I could do that. It 's just a pain when in PROPN PROPN I can hold down shift and drag to do this, but I ca n't in PROPN PROPN!
1263;neutral;You need to make the following changes to your code: However keep in mind that this is extremely vulnerable to PROPN injection, and you should also swap MySQL for PROPN/ PROPN immediately if you plan to use this code on a live website.
1264;positive;I understand not liking XAML, as it really intimidated me at first, but I will quickly say that it is a powerful tool. I am not sure how to do it through the designer, but in C# let 's say you name your PROPN' myDataGrid' and your List is named' stringList'. It is as simple as the following: and the data grid is now bound to your string list.
1265;positive;Very useful question and an excellent answer! Thanks
1266;negative;I was getting the same error when I tried to submit a version update from the PROPN. What solved my issue was using the PROPN PROPN found in the directory /Developer/ PROPN/ PROPN. You 'll need to compress your .app file and send the corresponding .zip file. I used this for my initial submission as well, I just thought I 'd try the new way. What a pain! Go with PROPN PROPN.

1268;positive;I am looking to create my own gestures for my PROPN app. I know this can be done but do n't know where to start. I read that there is some sample code that can store your custom gestures so you can re use them.

1285;negative;I have a PROPN PROPN PROPN app. My users have been complaining about form creep( as they call it), this is where each time you open a specific form within the main PROPN window it opens slightly below and to the right of the location it loaded previously- i.e. it starts in the top left of the window and works its way down to the bottom right. I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating, is there any way to prevent this? The code to load the forms is: I can address this somewhat by setting the forms start- up positions to' Manual' but then they just open directly on top of each other in the top left of the screen. Any other SO users come across this?

1300;negative;Now I think it is not possible in c++( without explicitly qualifying the namespace), it 's so sad :(

1325;positive;I SOLVED PROPN! I used PROPN API and it works fine :) Thank you for your help!!

1332;negative;Consider the following example: In the above example, inside filterOccupied I have to use four for matching type. This becomes really painful when the records has more than ten fields. Is there a better way to do this?
1333;neutral;Its not possible to just execute arbitrary code by being able to alter a string. Only when you output the string directly, or use it in PROPN should you be really worried.
1334;negative;The objective of my endeavour is to have a PROPN computer execute a command( or maybe a local script- on the target) over a local network. Ideally, I would use PROPN to do this but unfortunately my embedded target is running PROPN which is absolutely horrible. To do this, I would require an PROPN server running on PROPN. I looked into the PROPN port but it does n't work and development for that stalled six years ago. To wrap up, I am looking for an alternative solution to using PROPN on PROPN. So, any ideas?

I noticed that pages with empty divs do n't shift when I navigate between them. However, if I navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content, I see the shift. Should this be happening if all of my pages are using the same container, same fluid grid? Does this make sense? Can you sense my desperation?
1347;neutral;@JonSkeet Boy you really hated my edit.
1348;neutral;I just started practicing PROPN in my projects. I 'm developing a project now using php/ zend/ mysql and phpunit/ dbunit for testing. I 'm just a bit distracted on the idea of encapsulation and the test driven approach. My idea behind encapsulation is to hide access to several object functionalities. To make it more clear, private and protected functions are not directly testable(unless you will create a public function to call it). So I end up converting some private and protected functions to public functions just to be able to test them. I 'm really violating the principles of encapsulation to give way to micro function testability. Is this the correct way of doing it?
1349;positive;Thanks for posting this PROPN! Excellent work( saved me a month of R&D)!

1410;positive;In PROPN 2008, there are XML code snippets that seem to be pretty awesome :) However, it seems that the snippets we created do not indent properly. For example if we have the following code: We get something like: Is there any way to make it so that all lines keep the same indentation?
1411;negative;so i m using a simple submit binding to pass a function data: i just started working with PROPN so i was to write a basic print function to test this input out: my problem is when i hit submit i get a" you entered: undefined" but when i refresh the page the input that is in the form gets an alert. this is very frustrating! idk if this is a knockout problem or a simple HTML one.
1412;positive;This is excellent!
1413;positive;Thank you! That 's extremely helpful!
1414;neutral;To make it work with zeros just add: while( num>>= 1&& PROPN)
1415;neutral;You 're missing PROPN? Check out
1416;neutral;Some people are evidently typing in CAPTCHAs to look at porn.
1417;negative;In PROPN PROPN 2, if I press escape the page goes into PROPN mode, which seems to take text input as commands, rather than actually typing the text. Another oddity is the PROPN mode, and I have no idea what it does besides it seems to highlight text. I think they came installed with the theme that I got,' soda', maybe. Anyway, I searched and found out you can turn off PROPN mode by pressing' i'. Regardless, both of these modes are extremely annoying, how do I get rid of them?
1418;negative;I really really hate to ask this, but did you try rebooting?
1419;neutral;Why does n't the" -C" flag have an option to enable the" use utf8"-pragma?
1420;positive;I would like to implement the same type of functionality as this application: When a user selects a table view cell, the cell animates to fill the entire screen and reveals a new view while animating. I have been trying to find information on how to do this but ca n't quite seem to find any good resources. How can I accomplish this? Even just an idea of what to properly google search will be extremely helpful!
1421;neutral;describes the binary format of objects in some detail. The describes the format in excruciating detail.
1422;negative;The problem is exact what mysql is telling you: you have too much data for one table. Not only the number of fields are counting towards them, but also their size .. But the real problem is in your database design, you have designed a table that is crying out for help:' split me up, split me up!' You should your design ..
1423;negative;C is a cruel master!
1424;positive;No worries! I 've done the same thing many times on PROPN.
1425;neutral;added PROPN key for" icon view" folder PROPN
1426;negative;Hmm I fear I 've opened a PROPN 's box of higher maths! I 'll see if I can understand any of those articles ...
1427;neutral;logically, each" master" entity should be in its own table if you do n't, you 'll find joins will become very painful, and your generic PROPN table will accumulate all kinds of useless fields
1428;positive;I recently moved from a PROPN PROPN PROPN back to PROPN PROPN. The one thing I absolutely loved about textmate was it 's find/ search feature. It made navigating solution files so easy. Is there an equivalent shortcut/ PROPN for PROPN PROPN?
1429;negative;@Rob൩ I really hate passing booleans into functions.
1430;neutral;I want to get the autoincrement PROPN PROPN of an insert. is there a way to do it?
1431;neutral;This is quite new in PROPN( since 1.0).

1434;neutral;if you have a choice, try it with PROPN
1435;neutral;See
1436;positive;I do n't think there are any mature components too( for what I saw). You can use some dedicated PROPN components, like. We use it a lot in our project for our customers, and it 's really great!
1437;positive;It 's a progress bar! :) Setting makes it a rotating circle rather than a classic progress bar. There are several different styles you can use. Play around with them to find the one you like :) Hope this helps!
1438;neutral;I 've seen both this: and this: Does the type attribute matter in any way?
1439;negative;The search term on both PROPN and PROPN yields zero results, so this should be worth asking. I 've been fiddling around on PROPN and looking through PROPN PROPN PROPN .h files all day, and feeling a bit out of my element. I 'm basically attempting to query the PROPN endpoint mapper with managed code. Here is what I have so far: The above code is n't complete, but it illustrates my point. The code consistently returns: PROPN: 87 87 meaning PROPN is PROPN according to. So I 'm basically stumped at this point, and I 'm sure it 's because of my extremely crappy PROPN code.

I was thinking about using mocha with grunt, but i am trying to find out how it will really change something when i run my tests. How my tests will be more valuable using mocha( for example)? Regarding the success of these tools, i feel like i am missing something in their utility. If someone could explain to me how and when they are usefull, it would be really great!
1443;neutral;I am looking for a simple mode to to obtain automatic fit- to- window effect using a wx.grid. PROPN object inside on of my window.

1452;positive;The rendering issue has been fixed in PROPN. No need to worry!
1453;positive;Got it: I need to reference the class types through the createjs module. i.e. works absolutely fine!

1457;positive;This is a really great PROPN! Just give it a try, you will not regret it.
1458;positive;If you would like to switch to different network operators- The answer is No, you are not able to do that programmatically. There is no API that supports that. If you want to switch to different wireless networks the answer is Yes, read post. If you would like to check for different kinds of connectivity states- Look. Good luck, hope this helped!
1459;negative;" Error starting recording", every time. OH how I hate meaningless error messages!
1460;neutral;She should also use parameterized queries and not have to worry about quotes at all!
1461;positive;Excellent! Did you know that you can answer your own question and accept it as PROPN* the** answer. This is considered a good practice, because it helps people looking for answers see that there is an answer and it helps them find the answer. If the answer is only in comments, the question will appear unanswered.
1462;neutral;How can I write the following PROPN using PROPN: Attach the model.
1463;positive;No worries! Happens to all of us
1464;positive;No worries, and +1 to your answer!
1465;neutral;use an PROPN library though ... writing PROPN output directly is a huge pain!
1466;positive;BTW- your article on" the PROPN behind Transforms" is an excellent read- very helpful indeed!
1467;positive;Excellent, thank you! I do n't know when we are going to upgrade but that 's a good reason to I guess.
1468;negative;PROPN? And accept some answers, for crying out loud!
1469;neutral;I think you should use for embedding.
1470;positive;Excellent explanation! +1 for you PROPN
1471;negative;For various reasons PROPN decides that some info should be kept away from developers. But people through reverse engineering find out what these reserved fields are about and produce their own documentation. Some times people guess correct. Some times PROPN makes breaking changes, and people scream" How dare you!". And life goes on.
1472;positive;Excellent thanks!
1473;neutral;Is there a way to show an image up as greyscale, using purely javascript?
1474;negative;It is very sad :(
1475;positive;PROPN Oh, excellent! I see now that it 's a fairly obvious answer, but that tool is perfect. Thanks!
1476;positive;No worries, main thing is your problem gets solved!
1477;neutral;I would do the same( as PROPN), and agree at all( with PROPN).
1478;positive;Have a look at. I 've tried to get my" PROPN PROPN contacts" function working right now and that 's what I 've found this far. Works excellent!
1479;positive;Yeah ... I 'm not a huge fan. Their documentation, tutorials, and guides are pretty nice. Here 's the guide:  # top/ PROPN Here 's the documentation:    Here 's the video tutorial for PFQueryTableView:   ( A little dated but very nice) Hope this helps! :)
1480;positive;Please see: for an excellent fix! Much easier to implement and more versatile than the answer above.
1481;negative;It 's very painful to add multiple tickets to PROPN or to have it as your own todo list. That causes people to use their own task management tools so tasks are then spread all around. Is there any plugin or macro that would quicken the process of adding a ticket?
1482;negative;PROPN I 'm afraid I do n't understand what you mean! That example is using an ajax call when creating a PROPN object to get the data.
1483;neutral;PROPN there are no native language constructs for this. If you need it for debugging purposes I would advice you to have deeper look into the PROPN extension especially( awesome! :) Another idea would be to implement in your class and wrap all public methods. But this requires to change the code and has other side effects:( simplified example). Example:
1484;negative;They sure did n't @MichaelSzyndel. It 's extremely frustrating. I am using the latest ver, too. I really would like to get it working properly.
1485;negative;Why on my" git push" command I get the following very scaring error message? I 've appended the text as it appeared on my shell, the strange symbols are shown. Is my PROPN installation broken? My fist PROPN clone was using https I 'm using on PROPN 10.10 x86_64
1486;positive;I downloaded and read Rails As She Is Spoke, what an excellent book, thanks for the recommendation!
1487;positive;Is there a way to pattern match in PROPN# so that it will check to see if both elements in a two element tuples are equal. I 'm incredibly new to PROPN#, and also new to the whole concept of PROPN PROPN in general. I was thinking something along the lines of ... But I guess that would be too easy hah. Any suggestions? Or is there even a way to do that? Thanks for your help, you guys are incredibly helpful!
1488;negative;When querying from the database using PROPN PROPN, what exceptions should one catch and what should be done about them? Generally I use because I have no specific action or feedback for every possible type of error, but I am constantly reminded that this is a terrible idea and that specific exceptions should be caught and handled! Example: What are the standards/ guidelines for handling PROPN exceptions?
1489;negative;I am trying to override PROPN- PROPN- Down PROPN and PROPN- Meta- Up PROPN in emacs. I 've tried all sorts of combinations of: and: etc ... but it always says:. This means it is only taking into account the. Why is it ignoring the PROPN?? I 've been working on this for 3 hours and emacs online documentation with regards to key bindings is surprisingly absolutely terrible.
1490;positive;This is incredibly useful, thank you!
1491;positive;+1 excellent! I was searching it for hours ...
1492;negative;In VB.NET you can, with the keyword( I believe). But what you 're trying to do seems really horrible. Just set them explicitly. It 's almost exactly the same amount of code.
1493;negative;I kept a bitmap inside a movieClip, bitmap has been set to be smoothing. but when I changed the scale of this movieclip, it still got pixelated. Do we have the way to avoid. it is really painful.
1494;positive;I 'm wondering how PROPN works, anybody knows? I know how to do the push notification from server to PROPN, but I have no clue of how to create the server to get the @reply and dm from twitter in real time. Any suggestion on what I should look into to create the server? Should I use PROPN 's streaming API or PROPN PROPN PROPN? Any sample code, in PROPN preferably, will be great :) Thanks!
1495;negative;I have a client server application that communicate through wcf at PROPN mode stream. when the client try to download the file in one peace, its working but when The client try to take the whole file in 2 peaces, the file that downloaded is damaged and can not be open.

1502;positive;No upvotes? I 'll give you the first one!! Excellent domain issue regarding these kind of apps!
1503;positive;Two excellent answers, thank you! I chose PROPN 's primarily because I learned a bit more about knockout from it, but both are good options. I 'd use PROPN 's method to get something to use in a more generic" anything can be chosen" scenario, but I think making it a single object is probably a better fit for my uses.
1504;positive;PROPN PROPN has a really excellent blog post on this:
1505;positive;So I have a facebook page and a username /llamafont so I obviously want to keep that url. I have had the like button on sub pages( you save phrases and can like/ share them on PROPN) since before I made the page on PROPN. When I have added the like button to my homepage for my base url, it shows 62k likes- PROPN! However on my facebook page i only have 107- I guess these are the people who liked the page directly on PROPN? How can I make the 62 PROPN likes show up on my page in PROPN? Do I need to add in all the meta og: stuff? Right now I only have og: image in there. Have I screwed it up for good? Or can I make PROPN recognize the likes somehow? Thanks in advance!
1506;neutral;This question is n't about what' semantic- web' usually means.
1507;negative;CorePlot: PROPN PROPN, how to set more distance between every stick when zoom in and zoom out? When i try to zoom out, it looks really terrible. How can i fix it?
1508;neutral;How about, which responds with JSON?
1509;neutral;When you submit a form, does the button that was clicked get posted also?
1510;positive;Excellent, thanks!
1511;neutral;similarly: PROPN PROPN= more
1512;positive;I would use! to get everything with tag just do: to get the value inside of span you could do: there are tons of differnt methods of getting the informaton you need PROPN PROPN hope this helps!
1513;negative;is n't generic, so your code is effectively: At that point is it clearer why you need the cast?( Not that the cast will really anything at execution time, of course ...) You 're not calling which is what you really want to be doing, effectively. It 's just another case of PROPN generics being a bit of a pain :(
1514;neutral;Uh, PROPN PROPN, read the docs." Example# 2 array_filter() without callback"
1515;positive;That looks like a really excellent article, thanks for linking it. :) Where are you getting stuck? Do your logfiles show attempts to access the mobile content? If you add some logging to your browser detection, can you tell when the PROPN PROPN emulator is connecting vs when a desktop browser connects?
1516;neutral;The PROPN in PROPN stands for PROPN. If you do n't have a extremely good reason to use PROPN, do n't use it!
1517;positive;PROPN PROPN, thank you!
1518;negative;PROPN. parsing HTML with regexes. horrible horrible horrible.
1519;negative;I am currently workin on a visual studio PROPN hosted project that uses PROPN for version control and have run into a problem with the team explorer PROPN. All of my collegues get this view when connecting to the project: But on my machine, i m missing the tiles/ buttons and have to right click the current branch, choose manage branches and from there, select PROPN/ Unsynced commits to handle my code which is extremely annoying. I m using PROPN PROPN 2013 PROPN for this project, but i also have PROPN installed.
1520;positive;aaaaawesome!!!! Thanks a lot
1521;positive;I have just read and I really loved to the question. Naturally, an interesting question popped in my head ... How to add my own events( of my own applications) in the PROPN PROPN-> PROPN and PROPN PROPN-> PROPN-> PROPN Events? And another related question, that I suppose should be answered here as well is ... How do I play those sounds specified in the PROPN PROPN, when the event in my application occurs?
1522;positive;I 'd be interested to hear how this works out. You are very brave :)
1523;neutral;PROPN A lot has happened in nearly 6 years:
1524;negative;Yes. You make me sad :(
1525;neutral;Short answer: no, there is no way for your application to be aware( for instance with an event that is raised) that its hosting process has been brutally killed.
1526;negative;Never been this frustrated before ... I HATE UIs! Will have to deal with them one day
1527;positive;wow, awesome! never knew this. Thanks again!
1528;negative;Tools to automate alteration of markup code for any objective are a horribly frightful proposition. Simply write your code correctly the first time. If you have archaic code then it likely has many other problems in addition to SEO, and automatically imposing global changes can expose problems you may not be prepared to address.
1529;neutral;Also, you might find that being able to cast our variables makes working with events in PROPN bliss.
1530;positive;excellent question, thanks!
1531;neutral;I do n't think there is a native way to do this(). But you can do it naively( this will be efficient, but is a pain to write! ):
1532;neutral;What possible enhancements can be made in the PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN?
1533;positive;@panique No worries!
1534;positive;+1 for actually* answering* the question.
1535;negative;A copy of an infinitely long string terrifies me!
1536;negative;After installing a lot of apps, and building a few myself, I 'm sure many people have been wondering about this. If I 'm looking through my SD card it looks absolutely horrible, and its really hard to find folders that are mine for putting music/ videos/ pictures in between all the folders for different applications. Is there any conventions here that we, the developers, should try to put their apps into one base folder or has PROPN forgot about this completely?
1537;negative;My NSLog messages no longer show up in my PROPN PROPN. Anyone have an idea how the could have happened? I can hit command-7 to bring of a list of logs in the left pane, select the latest one and view it in my editor window, but it is extremely annoying compared to having the console output in the debug area.
1538;neutral;So could you swap 2 user 's passwords by moving the password hashes in that file?
1539;negative;Could you break this down for me? This looks scary :O
1540;neutral;Then what should you do?
1541;neutral;I 'm a complete newbie to PROPN. Can somebody explain to me how this works?
1542;positive;No worries, his answer is much better!
1543;neutral;Which D? There are at least a few D 's around
1544;positive;Excellent, thanks! This was very useful to me.
1545;positive;Excellent, thanks for that!
1546;negative;Instead of loading everything which is neither possible nor really desirable I would use a sliding window instead- when you reach a certain maximum list size( say i.e. 300 items) you automatically remove the top 100 items when you add the next 100 items to the bottom. If you scroll just right after the update this should n't even be noticeable by your users.
1547;negative;Hate ghost comments! :(
1548;negative;Here is my PROPN code .. .. I 'm extremely crappy with my PROPN code, could someone help me convert this? I basically want to convert a variable such as" marine- heavy" to" PROPN( heavy)".
1549;negative;I really hate to answer my own question but I found the problem and the report is opening as of right now. I only came across this by chance but it seemed to work. I changed the setting of PROPN on PROPN PROPN to Do Not Display. I never noticed that option before so I gave it a try. PROPN is on the laptop which I did n't know at the time and I know nothing about it, but at least it shows on the screen now.
1550;positive;I am using as templating engine and I am really loving it. However, now I have run in a situation which definitely mustbe accomplishable in a simpler way than I have found. What I have right now is this: What I am looking for is something more like this: Is there a way to accomplish this which I have n't seen yet? If I need to create my own extension, how can I access myVar within the test function? Thanks for your help!
1551;positive;Excellent! Just what i needed!
1552;neutral;Yes, PROPN is really painful. But it 's still powerful. In many cases, you can not escape from it. Lets check this tiny utility to see it it ease your pain
1553;neutral;Try using a instead. I do n't think PROPN guarantee order. output
1554;positive;Excellent! Thank you so much for the thorough explanation, and for providing the demo. So` eval()` allows you to access the value stored in each variable. This is handy if you want the name of your variable to itself be stored in a variable. Handy! You did an excellent job explaining. Gold star for you. :)
1555;neutral;If you are really worried to know user 's PROPN PROPN then you need to determine the PROPN and pass that to action .. Look at

1561;neutral;Hi I am developing an android app a musicplayer. It works well except when you hit back key of your phone. It keeps playing song in back ground which is very desirable, but when you open the application again to pause or stop it does not works. I guess a new instance of the application is created on opening the app again. I do nt want to create a new instance i want to open the older one to stop it. I hope i am clear. Is there any way to do this.
1562;positive;Excellent, thanks very much!
1563;negative;In python 's the following minimal working example below draws correctly to the screen, and to the. In the resulting however, the edge lines are still drawn. How can I fix this? PNG result PROPN result While it seems trivial, it becomes extremely problematic when you stack 200 plots, all you see is an ugly mess of black!
1564;negative;I got it .. this is incredibly silly question! Static means I just access it directly from Without using it from the instance.
1565;negative;That 's terrible :(
1566;neutral;Prune them.
1567;negative;what is that downvote? it 's real and valid question, and I hate PROPN too!
1568;negative;You should never, ever use. It gets really really slow as the size of table grows. Instead you should. In case you have irrational fear of learning, here is there solution which would do what you ask for:
1569;negative;To my limited knowledge, in PROPN, any activity must belong to a given process. However, the book says:" The activity life cycle is not tied to the process life cycle." that is to say, even if the process has been completely killed, its activities can still be alive! What makes me confused is: Because the input handlers of an activity are bound to the process. If the process has been killed, how do its activities react to the user 's inputs?
1570;negative;Does anybody have a simple code to display a list( list view?) of all the apps installed on a phone, and have the user open one when clicked? Or even an PROPN drawer. I just need a way to have the user open all of their apps. I have tried searching for tutorials, but could n't find any, and I downloaded the example home from PROPN, but I absolutely hate looking through code and digging out what I Want.
1571;negative;I would guess it is doing basic sanity checking( i.e. should anything have changed)- to prevent unexpected source code changes( I hate it when opening a file can cause side- effects- I 'm looking at you, PROPN!). On a side note, to force serialization generally( I do n't think it will apply due to the above ): the and are a convention used by the framework.
1572;positive;after some tests i found a fast solution, you can add in top of your index page: it work very fine :)
1573;neutral;Does not work in PROPN 1.0
1574;negative;:( :( :( :( :( :(
1575;positive;Excellent question! I ca n't figure this out either. Please post the answer here if you figure it out.
1576;positive;PROPN, Your solution is absolutely awesome! But, just to share, I have been using this method above until I see your ideia. So, it seems not to be the best solution for this, but for sure it is a way around.
1577;positive;No worries, just run some tests and see what fits better your usecase!
1578;neutral;I answered this a couple of days ago:
1579;negative;I m off to bed, maybe fresh eyes will spot it.
1580;positive;I would like to get back all the option selected of a multiple select when i submit my form. like: using somthing like that: and get an array with all the value selected like[' 2','3'] All that, without PROPN and in PROPN or php is fine :) thx!
1581;neutral;The clue is: If you actualy have defined the table, then you have suffered the major( probably only!) sqlite gotcha. If the database file does nt exits it will quietly create an empty database for you. Double check you file path and look for a new empty sq3 file appearing in your directory.
1582;positive;I have discovered a mode in, where I can instantly change all same variables. When I am in this mode I get a box around the same variables and I can change one and instantly all others change. I do not know how to enter this mode" by will", I just entered it" randomly". Therefore, I really appreciate your suggestions, how to enter this mode, because it is extremely useful to me! PROPN.: I am using NO plugins, just a plain new eclipse installation with java!
1583;neutral;Can library under PROPN be used in the commercial software? How about lgpl?
1584;neutral;Try to add the complete failed message in the question!
1585;negative;It seems very tedious! I have a nine table join to join together, where two of the tables is a inner join and the rest 6 is left outer joins. Is it doable in entity?
1586;neutral;not woking at PROPN, and not support pathogen
1587;neutral;I can confirm that this works.

1592;negative;I am referring to this behaviour:( PROPN does n't include the mouse PROPN in the screen shot, I 'm hovered on the uppermost(+) here.) I find this incredibly annoying in some cases, especially with larger methods. In, I have both checkboxes blank.
1593;negative;I used multiple requests- batches of 10. I do n't want to anger the PROPN!
1594;positive;excellent in my case use the following code PROPN!!
1595;negative;I got very angry with PROPN today after reading lots of editable PROPN solutions involving setOnEditCommit, which is just NOT the right way it should be done. Following is a much better and simpler solution I found after digging the PROPN source:
1596;neutral;Also, you need to use`$( this)` instead of just` this`
1597;negative;Still no go, I am afraid :/ This does not remove' www' from the url.
1598;positive;excellent, thanks much!
1599;negative;I 'm having the exact same problem! Incredibly annoying!
1600;neutral;Perhaps you have not set up the terminal settings Follow the steps below: Open terminal Go to your folder where you want to install cocos2d write Cocos2d will install successfully Enjoy PROPN!!
1601;neutral;What PROPN methods correspond to these PROPN PROPN methods?
1602;neutral;This is by design-& is usually a desirable outcome! Linq- to- PROPN inserts child objects to preserve relational integrity. If you can turn that off somehow, the next obvious solution is to remove the relationship. This is not an ideal suggestion but it will work. Now PROPN does not have a PROPN object, and hence the PROPN statement will not insert your PROPN
1603;neutral;You should be able to set an expectation on and then call directly.
1604;neutral;$ row is blank after the query
1605;neutral;I 've never come across native support for this( although that 'd be pretty awesome), but there* might* be a plugin( or you could write it yourself!).
1606;positive;Excellent, thanks!
1607;positive;Thank you for the excellent answers! @ArnoldSpence is correct: It is indeed a case of memory fragmentation. I confirmed this by modifying my example above to allocate a series of 49 MB buffers after the reaching the" OUT OF PROPN" condition. Sure enough, these all succeeded( up to the 2 PROPN limit).
1608;negative;I 'm afraid I do n't know of any other option than work!
1609;positive;Excellent icons on!!! We use them in PROPN PROPN application You can see screenshots here: I also found some good icons here: Hope this helps!!!
1610;positive;Well, again thanks for your help, it works very great! Have a nice day =)
1611;neutral;Duplicate question
1612;neutral;Then you could better do PROPN PROPN, to get` PROPN_ file PROPN_`.
1613;negative;We have released a beta version of our software, and as we talked to people who started using it, we have found that a lot of the features( which we thought were essential) were not known and not used by the users. What are the possible ways to inform the application users about the features of the application? I personally find the" PROPN of the day" popups extremely annoying and disable them quickly. Are there better ways?
1614;positive;@Joel- no worries!
1615;positive;Great! Absolutely wonderful! Thank you very much!
1616;positive;Excellent! Thank you for the follow- up. I added a variation above.
1617;neutral;You should be more explicit as to which RDBMS you are using.
1618;negative;If it 's forms auth then yes, that 's weird. I 'm afraid I do n't have any idea!
1619;neutral;If you 're really worried about string/ character size, have you thought about compressing them? That would automatically reduce the string to it 's' minimal' encoding. It 's a layer of headache, especially if you want to do it in memory, and there are plenty of cases in which it would n't buy you anything, but encoding, especially, tend to be too general purpose to the level of compactness you seem to be aiming for.
1620;positive;please update and you will get to paradise PROPN
1621;positive;No worries! How do I determine the difference between template or class?
1622;neutral;You can use contents along with filter. Try this: Working example@
1623;negative;I now have this extremely ugly solution. Anybody a better idea?
1624;positive;excellent! it works. but could you please explain how this works? Does javascript take time to load? could a thread.sleep step done the same thing?
1625;neutral;How is it invariant if you 're using the current culture?
1626;neutral;well, without binding I only managed with: it redraws everything ...
1627;neutral;Links are no longer valid fyi
1628;negative;:'( :'( :'( :'( PROPN :'(
1629;neutral;And windows 7? Is 3.5 PROPN preinstalled, or is it just 3.5 out of the box?
1630;neutral;if the mouse button is depressed, give him some xanax!
1631;neutral;I bet it can not be simpler than that:
1632;positive;Very excited for my first post on PROPN! I would like to create an animation like in PROPN I am not having much luck with what CABasicAnimation has to offer. Feels like I may need one of those fancy physics engines ...(?) How would one properly begin do this? Thanks!
1633;negative;PROPN is down again.
1634;neutral;Is this PROPN .NET or PROPN?
1635;neutral;Not really, you have to declare the functions somewhere visible to the caller. Header file is the most convenient way to do it, because it provides an interface. A possible approach is to merge those headers into one .h file, so you provide a single and complete interface with your library. The only other approach I can think about is declaring the functions in the files where you call them, but this is much more devastating and error prone then including a header file.
1636;positive;I am trying to make my javascript change when the window resizes, but can not seem to get it to work. The only difference I would like is for the offset().top to change from -90 to -60 as the window becomes smaller than 768px. This is what I have so far: Any advice would be really great! Thank you
1637;positive;excellent bonus tip re lcd! I did n't know that existed, but will be very useful.
1638;negative;This is an internal error* in the PROPN PROPN PROPN*. Something more heinous is going on here, I do n't think this is an error in your PROPN code.
1639;neutral;You could use my PROPN decorator:
1640;positive;Excellent answer! Bonus marks for humour!
1641;neutral;How can i embed a mobile number with the external link using objective PROPN
1642;positive;Here is the working solution .. Tested in PROPN/ PROPN/ PROPN .. Split the setter into a separate method. Working grrrrreat! Enjoy ... Controller: View:
1643;neutral;where do we need to copy the msvsmon.exe file onto the server?
1644;negative;This answer is not optimal because I have no clue which PROPN you are referring to.
1645;neutral;not cross platform
1646;positive;I have two classes, a PROPN and a PROPN class. The PROPN builds the frame and button, and the Customer class gets the info from a database server. I have the PROPN in the PROPN class, but it does n't appear to be noticing when I click the button. Any help is extremely appreciated! PROPN PROPN: PROPN PROPN:
1647;neutral;What version of the framework are you using?
1648;positive;This would be easiest with a- no need to be scared, it 's just a box!
1649;neutral;I 'm running PROPN on my PROPN auto- scaling array of servers. As soon as I have more than 1 server, there is the obvious problem where the socket.io connections need to be shared between the servers. This is where you 'd normally use the PROPN store plugin that comes with socket.io. Unfortunately, I use MongoDB( not redis), and the cost of adding another database to my stack would be prohibitively high. I tried using the module, but it absolutely killed my servers( huge CPU usage). Is there any other way to share the socket.io session between PROPN servers?
1650;negative;Is this seriously the only way to modify the default template? This seems absolutely terrible.
1651;neutral;And` PROPN==== PROPN` will make you even angrier( syntax errors always do!)
1652;neutral;I had the same problem and I ended up doing this: The idea is that I can use PROPN without extremely ugly array formatting.
1653;neutral;Boost is also not PROPN
1654;neutral;I have a lot of classes and this is a lot of work to do the XML mappings.
1655;positive;Wow, great! Thanks a lot!
1656;positive;very awesome! You just saved me a boatload of time.
1657;neutral;This is the table: What I have to change in the model? Will ko3 PROPN work?
1658;neutral;Do you mean the connection is kept open between post- backs?
1659;positive;I have seen a lot of examples of PROPN classes that utilize the method of and I am not sure what the advantage of using it would be. Example: Any insight would be extremely helpful! Thanks!
1660;positive;Wow, excellent thanks for going to the effort to measure the performance! +1
1661;positive;Excellent! Thanks very much. Do n't understand why I did not try to find it myself. Thanks again.
1662;neutral;What about:
1663;neutral;Figured this one out myself see answer below
1664;neutral;I try to export ant buildfile, then i run the build.xml. Then what next?
1665;neutral;In PROPN graphics, what 's the difference between material and texture?
1666;negative;I have a complex site that incorporates alot of javascript and it is getting absolutely KILLED by PROPN. How would I go about serving this code: HTML JS In such a way that PROPN never gets the and therefore never hides?
1667;neutral;how to do this effect?. what way of all the words on the image are put?
1668;neutral;Web API is bundled with PROPN 4. It can be used separately and in combination with PROPN. There are some rough edges around the integration but nothing very painful.
1669;negative;I have to setup a rails project and rubygems.org is seemed to be down. That 's really horrible. Ca n't believe it the whole PROPN community have only one single not- so- reliable gems source. What should I do in such case?
1670;neutral;according to php.net date('m') should should 01 but i 'm getting 1 instead
1671;negative;I found this code( full version here) It 's work for me but now i do n't know how to stop it( for making test it 's horrible, my new php file not interpreted!)
1672;positive;@R .. Wow! Really great answer!! You should post it as an answer here, as it 's really more precise. Just a question, though, when you say round for the alignment of the type, you mean that if for example on your example you had a short b instead of PROPN PROPN, it would be aligned to offset 2, instead of 1?
1673;neutral;No I did not. The question is- which files ..
1674;positive;Ah- excellent- thanks!
1675;positive;I am designing a contact form which has a' Thank you' message pop up on send, I need my thank you message to be positioned relative, other wise if the user happens to scroll while the animation is running the message remains stuck in place and ruins the animation. However positing the div relative keeps it in the position before it loads, what I need is a way to have the div display: none or opacity:0 BEFORE the send button is pressed, is that possible? Here is an to explain what I 'm trying to achieve a little better And below is the PROPN I 'm using Any help would be really appreciated :) Thanks guys!
1676;negative;PROPN, this PROPN has a horrible interface!
1677;neutral;how did you solve it then?
1678;neutral;If your matrix is called, just use:
1679;positive;Godd luck, hope you figure it out! :)
1680;positive;Excellent- I 'm glad you found it! The double quotes may be a PROPN/ PROPN thing. Note that PROPN will accept` username/ PROPN` or` PROPN/ PROPN PROPN.
1681;positive;I was using an old version of PROPN- updated to version 1.0 and it works fine :) Thanks everyone!
1682;neutral;PROPN is in PROPN, not System. Collections. Generic as reported by the PROPN page.
1683;positive;Your example files are well- formed PROPN. Excellent! This means you can use a simple PROPN script. See
1684;negative;Offtopic: why the hell do you apply the regexp only to the first 4 characters of the user agent? This is going to fail horribly in most cases.
1685;positive;Thanks, everyone! I learned something extremely valuable :D So PROPN does n't stop at the 26th value?
1686;neutral;@Grav: So a secondary thread ... That is what I said.

1688;positive;+1 for IntelliJ. Worth every penny.
1689;positive;Thanks, this is extremely helpful!!
1690;negative;It 's not possible to open the page in full screen without user interaction( clicking on a button etc.) because it would be extremely annoying.
1691;positive;I found that the best way to do this was to use PROPN and save as a text file and then you can set your own field width and export. excellent!
1692;negative;The answer with a PROPN is completely ridiculous( no sense at all) The PROPN PROPN is of course given by PROPN()(!)
1693;positive;Great :) thanks!
1694;positive;I was wondering- when making my website- how i can put a bottom margin that lifts an a- tag up. CSS: And here 's also my html: I really hope you can help me out :) greetings form the PROPN!

1696;positive;I 've always really loved slice assignment:
1697;negative;This is the third post I 've seen with people filtering by PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN- code- it 's a terrible idea! Where are you getting these examples from?
1698;neutral;how is blue similar to green?
1699;neutral;Definitely a point to take note of.
1700;neutral;How do I create a table with fixed header and scrolling rows in struts 2?
1701;positive;There is this about hardware to improve compile time. Also this really excellent from PROPN PROPN on looking at hard drive speed for performance.
1702;positive;@NathanSmith Great success! If you submit that as an answer instead of a comment, I 'll accept it!

1705;neutral;IDEA importing PROPN .launch files.
1706;negative;I have a file in the form If I try to splot such file, gnuplot intended it as a surface, and the result is very awful( because the endpoint of a line is close to the endpoint of next line, not to the first point). How can I plot them as different lines( as every line was in a different file)?
1707;neutral;They may have just moved it from client side to server side.
1708;negative;It 's really sad when you ca n't trust your coworkers ...
1709;neutral;They are timestamp in real life- I simplified the question
1710;negative;I m afraid is not!
1711;neutral;Is there a way within PROPN/ PROPN to create a new mysql database at runtime?
1712;neutral;if you 're really, really worried about performance, using a live nodelist might be faster: This is unlikely to make much of a difference though, and as has been mentioned, using PROPN with long intervals( a second is big, 4ms is small) is unlikely to have any major effects.
1713;negative;I afraid here the relation between PROPN and PROPN in a single row could not be maintained!!!
1714;neutral;ImportError: can not import name gtkpixbuf
1715;positive;That 's terrific, thank you!
1716;negative;_ Automagically_ appending data to` PROPN/ authorized_keys` sounds scary!
1717;neutral;What is the code equivalent of setting endpoint headers in configuration?
1718;neutral;Is it the PROPN that runs out of memory or the PROPN process?
1719;negative;Okay I am using the same PROPN and PROPN .. but it does n't work for me :( .. Its very irritating, I have tried everything to make it work!
1720;negative;I had figured out the solution. What I realized was happening was that The deployments stopped working period, not just certain files were not coming across. This is absolutely a bug in PROPN deployment as near as I can figure. I had to drop& recreate my site in the cloud and the deployment continued to work. As a side rant. PROPN makes it extremely painful for someone to submit a bug as compared to other software vendors. And they wonder why their market share is shrinking.
1721;neutral;If your end goal is to add elements to your page, just manipulate the DOM directly. Do n't use string concatenation to try to create HTML- what a pain! See how much more straightforward it is to just create your element, instead of the HTML that represents your element: Then, later when you put the element in your page, instead of setting the of the parent element, call:
1722;positive;Excellent, thanks!
1723;neutral;The problem with your code is that you are getting the text of the function in your" template" variable. You still need to that text to create an actual PROPN instance on the window. The problem as a whole is that you are abusing the text! plugin, what you really need to do is use the modules of PROPN instead of hanging your variables on the window.
1724;positive;I want to programatically detect if my site is within the PROPN PROPN app so I can display certain features specifically for PROPN. Otherwise if someone goes site without PROPN. Preferably an FBML, C# or JS solution would be great :) PROPN!
1725;neutral;Try using PROPN( open authentication)
1726;negative;I absolutely hate how tabs work in PROPN. However, the only workaround i found that works decent is using the PROPN PROPN shortcuts: PROPN+ PROPN+-> PROPN+ PROPN+<-
1727;positive;I need to develop a messenger- like text box, where certain tokens are being replaced with PROPN controls. Just for example, if the user types :-) it should be replaced with a smiley image. I have previous experience with PROPN 's RichTextBox and i understand the concept of PROPN and PROPN. I just do n't know how to replace a PROPN with a PROPN control ... Would extremely appreciate your help :-)! Gili
1728;negative;I think it should be a warning. Generally speaking, the common rule is that' you should treat warnings as errors'. If I unintentionally write unreachable code, I will see it in the warnings, and fix it anyway. However, sometimes, like PROPN says, you intentionally create dead code, for debugging purposes or whatever reason. I 'd really, really hate it if the compiler would not let me do that.
1729;positive;Excellent! I 'll add it as an answer so you can close the question properly. Glad I could help.
1730;negative;I ca n't believe sql server does n't have a feature for this ..
1731;positive;" two jsons"<- priceless!
1732;positive;Excellent! Thank you so much!

1734;positive;Has anyone seen a wordpress plugin slider that will show partially the next and previous image before it slides in? OR does anyone know of one that may be easily customized to show that effect? any PROPN, guidance or links will be extremely helpful! Thanks very much in advance! PROPN
1735;negative;a very sad face :(
1736;neutral;you have to use symlinks instead of an alias ... sad there is no ui for that! you have to go into the PROPN and type: the first PROPN is the base path of the original file and the second is for the base path for the symlink of the file/ folder etc
1737;neutral;PROPN- PROPN No worries!
1738;positive;Thanks! Give it a try! It works excellent! If you can build the URL string correctly of course, PROPN
1739;neutral;I also would like to see an answer to this ..
1740;positive;Excellent- now if I set the main ImageView layout_weight to 3 and the inner PROPN to 1, I get the 75/25 effect I wanted too! Thanks PROPN!
1741;positive;PROPN 2 working demos for you: or both works fine: Hope this helps, have a good one, cheerios! code:
1742;negative;when I 'm drag and drop some in chrome, it always make some noise, you can try it in your chrome: click on some empty place, then drag, then release mouse, it makes the sound. I really hate it, and I have seen some page do n't have the chime sound, and I think it can avoid use javascript, can anyone tell me?
1743;neutral;Is there a way to grep for only calls that over a certain amount of time?
1744;neutral;Try this, you will avoid the much dreaded IN operator with subqueries( they can sometimes be inefficient, to say the least)!
1745;neutral;What are the differences between PROPN and PROPN? What about theming?
1746;neutral;here, bro:
1747;negative;I 've been having this issue for some time and kept just disabling the" PROPN" tab which is really annoying! I tried to click the pause button so it 's flashing and refresh, same issue. Then, click so it 's not flashing and refresh, same issue. I just now clicked the pause button( so it was blinking), then PROPN- clicked it so it was not blinking, and then refreshed the page and it seems to have fixed it. The same page that was breaking on a script error is no longer breaking on the error.
1748;positive;Still using PROPN, it 's excellent!
1749;neutral;If it comes with an incredibly annoying sound, then it 's a PROPN. It not, then it 's maybe some kind of child window- see
1750;negative;Oh, man, I am sorry but I must say it: your code is really awful ... It is not organised at all, but maybe ... should n't be instead? EDIT: try to comment the second and third queries, since they seem useless, and make the" cur"->" cursor" change I suggested:
1751;negative;she records the class( the computer screen PROPN) but it 's very useless! she confuses herself and the class ..
1752;negative;The dreadful integer arithmetic attacks again! When you calculate(( 3+ 2+ 1)/100), since all the operands are integers, PROPN uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point arithmetic. If you do 7/100 it will also return 0, as it 's rounded down to the nearest integer, which is 0.
1753;neutral;How can I use variable names other than$ it$ in a PROPN partial?
1754;negative;It 's a very painful process to ajax` files` to a server side script. You might try:
1755;neutral;If i give will the search engine consider PROPN"" to be noindex, PROPN?
1756;neutral;I forgot to mention one thing. You need to add this filter above PROPN filter in web.xml
1757;neutral;Did you ever find a solution?
1758;positive;Drama- free and practical. +1.
1759;positive;PROPN yeah ... definitely positive!
1760;negative;Its really depressing. Ended up with downloading the whole bundle again.
1761;neutral;PROPN( this is to get 10 chars)
1762;negative;I am sorry to say this but most PROPN grids do not support cell merging. At least not out of the box. I have resorted to using PROPN One studio for PROPN in order to achieve this, and even then it has n't been exactly a walk in the park. Consider PROPN PROPN PROPN control. Here is a sample on with sample code and a small write up. The down side of such solutions is that PROPN 's controls are extremely expensive :( I wish PROPN came up with some enhancements in PROPN that would accommodate for such issues.
1763;positive;Excellent, thanks!
1764;neutral;did you ever come up with anything for this?
1765;positive;I use PROPN on windows with and i 'm loving it!.
1766;negative;I have run into this too. It is very annoying! Here 's why it might be happening. The width of your PROPN items, plus any margins is more than the width of# maincontainer. That means the last PROPN item spills over# maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in, leaving an extra click. One way to check this: assign an PROPN PROPN to the last li, and make the width less, and see if that does n't fix it. If so you need to make the# maincontainer wider.
1767;negative;does n't mean nothing. You have to use
1768;neutral;That 's where I 'm using the extra switch, yes.
1769;negative;How I hate myserlf!
1770;positive;Excellent! Your first comment is right on the spot, the other two calls are not necessary. I 'll be happy to accept your answer if you create one.
1771;negative;sad faces! :( not workoing.
1772;negative;It would be sad :(
1773;negative;I realise this is probably an absolutely horrible way to do a query, and of course its not working. The point of it is to select users based on a date range and a keyword.
1774;neutral;I generally do it before importing anything. If you 're worried that your module names might conflict with the PROPN stdlib names, then change your module names!
1775;neutral;Does input order for a SM 4.0 vertex shader matter? e.g. is equivalent to
1776;positive;Amazing how well this works! I had excellent answers immediately! It 's like I 'm living in the future!
1777;neutral;I found this on PROPN with PROPN PROPN. However, this article does n't explain why Transactions are needed or even desirable! Why would it be worth me trying to implement Transactions alongside my TableAdapters?
1778;neutral;Seconding PROPN 's question ....
1779;positive;Hi I just started playing with PROPN. It seems pretty awesome! Now coming from a PROPN background, how would one implement a type of options field like: So that it can be set like status= Open or something like that. Or should this just be a normal String field and I set it accordingly in my app?
1780;positive;Loved this solution!
1781;neutral;Which initialize() method are you referring to? Which class?
1782;negative;This is very strange, what are you trying to do here. It looks very scary code. Where are your constructors?
1783;negative;I have issues with PROPN( 3.6.0.201 ... 658) on dark themes. Every time I hit the cursor, the horizontal scroll bar in the workspace flickers into view and out again. This seems to be a bug, which has been reported already a long time ago: Has anyone else found a solution? Makes working in PROPN incredibly annoying.
1784;neutral;Is it possible to make play swf in full screen mode when PROPN page lunch?
1785;negative;Basically you 've got to call the method with reflection: Get the generic method template with PROPN passing in your 4 type parameters Invoke the method passing in the regular arguments It 's a pain :(
1786;negative;When I slide to a next image, or when the slider/ carousel automatically switches to the next image the previous image disapears too fast, which gives it an extremely ugly look. I 've made a video to make clear what I mean, can be checked over here. Anyone has an idea? Code for the carousel:
1787;positive;This is amazing ... I had no idea you could control PROPN elements without even needing to mess with the PROPN ... You are a hero :) thank you!!!!!!!!!!!
1788;negative;Is this valid? what I 'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time?
1789;negative;My company is just starting to look at using WPF for migrating all of our 10 year old business applications. These applications will most of the time be running on computers that have limited/ old hardware. We are now a little worried that the hardware might be too limited for using PROPN. We have installed PROPN. PROPN() on an basic older computer and that seems to run ok. But we would like know what your experiences with PROPN on older hardware is? Anyone out there willing to share some experiences with us?
1790;positive;That would be awesome. I could report 100% success rates on all e- mails! :)
1791;positive;PROPN PROPN PROPN gave an excellent talk at PROPN:    PROPN computing is definitely the way to go for bioinformatics!
1792;negative;you have your terminology horribly confused.
1793;negative;Any PROPN to this annoying topic?!
1794;positive;Got ta love stackoverflow!
1795;negative;I usually do n't post meta comments, but 29k views and 7 upvotes? That is sad
1796;negative;In this case, I 'd keep the PROPN() method but subscribe to it with: Admittedly that wo n't please those who do all their event wiring in the designer ... but I find it simpler to inspect, personally.( I also hate the autogenerated event handler names ...)
1797;positive;PROPN 's article is excellent reading on this topic.
1798;positive;+1. Great question! Now, I have no clue about the answer, but I 'll stay tuned.
1799;neutral;Make sure the designer does n't put anything that he thinks is fancy and well animated. Many a times, it becomes a big pain to simulate such effects in ASP.net unless you are a pro with CSS or PROPN. Coordination between designer and developer is a must according to me, so I would prefer to sit close to a designer till the base design of the page is finalized.
1800;neutral;It 's free in both meanings of the term.
1801;neutral;Your question assumes that mail clients follow the PROPN standards for PROPN encoding, which they do n't. I 'd advise you collect a bunch of mail from sources and try and process it as- it- exists. The problem you are facing is extremely difficult( perhaps impossible) to solve 100%.
1802;neutral;When all of the bugs from previous patches get merged into the main tree, we lose the" who did what" information. I think it is a shortcoming of PROPN for sure. Too many bug fix comments hurt in the long term- people are then afraid to touch stuff.
1803;neutral;I maintain an application which, during the course of two years, has constantly required new hardware to be even usable, due to the amount of new users/ new data inserted. However, justifying the investiment is sometimes very hard to do. I started to wonder- how can I establish the maximum number of users a web application currently suports? I thought of using PROPN scripts but they can get really nasty to implement when having to simulate file transfers and decison trees. What do you guys use?
1804;neutral;I need to send and receive data over serial connections( RS-232 and PROPN). How do I set up and communicate with such a connection? How do I figure out what the configuration settings( e.g. baud rate) should be and how do I set them? In particular I am looking to do this in PROPN, PROPN/ PROPN, or one of the major PROPN shells but I also have some interest in serial programming using PROPN/ PROPN.
1805;negative;This is how you find the arc length given the parameter, but finding equidistant points requires the inverse of this function. Getting from one to the other is not trivial. PROPN PROPN: how did you do it? I mean, you can just use binary search, but that would be horribly slow( for what I 'm trying to do, anyway).
1806;positive;+1- what a great article!
1807;positive;I 'll second Zend_Form; it has an excellent ini style implementation that allows you to define a form extremely quickly:
1808;positive;PROPN Saves a lot of time when unit testing PROPN PROPN layers. Just note that PROPN will often need PROPN which might not be desirable( depending on whether your app will need MSDTC)
1809;positive;Is there a way that I can get a list of the models that a particular model belongs to in Rails? For example: Hope this makes some kind of sense!
1810;positive;Anybody found yet a good web site architecture using linq to sql? Any help will be very helpful!
1811;positive;As you may know, tonight, at exactly 23:31:30 PROPN, PROPN PROPN will reach 1234567890! Hurray! One way of watching PROPN time is by using PROPN: Can you do the same in another programming language?
1812;neutral;I 'm getting notifications to back up my encryption key for PROPN in PROPN, however i have n't enabled bit locker or drive encryption. Anyone know how to find out what files may be encrypted or have an explanation for why it would notify me?
1813;negative;I have PROPN installed. But I was afraid about installing VS2008 and lose everything. I think I have to install 3.5 framework first. Is that correct?
1814;neutral;I want an simple PROPN/ editor for PROPN in PROPN to which I can add features easily. For example: I want to add a right click menu item and a related action for the editor. It should be easy to extent and add any desirable functionality. I tried eclipse PROPN but its to much of learning(I mean knowing the eclipse plug- in architecture and the PROPN extension points and stuff) to do for the small modification/ PROPN I want to do. Thanks, PROPN
1815;neutral;The length of a PROPN PROPN string in a narrow- Unicode build is the number of PROPN PROPN code units*, not actual PROPN code points. Truncating and other slicing options that go by arbitrary index can indeed split a surrogate pair in half, with the result of some missing/ replaced characters. On a narrow build,` unichr(0x10345)` simply fails;` PROPN')` is` 2`. This is the price you pay for easy interaction with PROPN PROPN APIs. Most other environments use PROPN which does n't suffer from any such problem.
1816;positive;Wow, exactly what i was looking for!
1817;neutral;If that is n't the longest qualification ever ...` Throw. In. Todays. News. While. PROPN. At. It( ...);`
1818;neutral;If it 's of any use to anyone, I made a. It removes the oldest item( bottom of stack) when it gets too big.( This question was the top PROPN result for" C# limit stack size")
1819;neutral;I 'm afraid I do n't know any answer other than to start looking around in your area for old hardware. The CPU is n't the only variable that can( usually) affect things. L1/ PROPN cache size, memory bus speed, memory speed/ latency, hard drive speed, etc. are all significant factors in many applications.
1820;neutral;Realted:
1821;positive;See also this excellent answer:
1822;neutral;If by' slickest' you mean fastest, I 'm afraid that Enumerable. Repeat may be 20x slower than a for loop. See: So use PROPN 's SetAllValues() method.
1823;positive;Thank you very much, this is really interesting stuff!
1824;neutral;If your worried about other people access your web service directly, you could check the calling PROPN address and host header and make sure it matches expected PROPN 's addresses. If your worried about people stealing information during it 's journey from the server to the client, PROPN is the only way to go.
1825;neutral;Why is PROPN included in the question title? SQLLite is not yet ported to PROPN 2, and what you do on the server side does n't really matter for the PROPN client application.
1826;positive;PROPN, I did n't know that the PROPN command line utility could generate one file for many asmx .... that s awesome! I 'll try that out now. I can integrate that into our build process too. Great, thank!
1827;neutral;It could also be a problem if you worried about running out of PROPN too fast( if you expect PROPN of records), since you 're only using 1/10 of the range you have storage for.
1828;neutral;I always try to avoid to return string literals, because I fear they are n't defined outside of the function. But I 'm not sure if this is the case. Let 's take, for example, this function: Is this correct code? It does work for me, but maybe it only works for my compiler( gcc). So the question is, do( string) literals have a scope or are they present/ defined all the time.
1829;negative;I have created a VB.Net lending application for a cooperative that caters to widows. The application tracks the members' loans and payments, and is also used as an accounting system. In my first release, the users felt that showing a messagebox every time an error occurs is very annoying. My solution is to output errors in a label control. The users accepted the modification, but i feel i am doing it wrong.
1830;positive;I m using the PROPN in PROPN PROPN to map all my entities and that all works fine :D However, several of my objects have In the database there is a single comments table, and each entity with the above code, has its own link table to comments. At the moment what i m doing is: for every entity. Is there some way i can set a convention where by all mappings to PROPN< Comment> are wired up automatically as manytomany with the above table name convention? Thanks PROPN
1831;neutral;Would use double. PROPN, it has performance benefits.
1832;neutral;" You should never use a named mutex"- never say never. If malicious code is running on my machine, I 'm probably already hosed.
1833;negative;PROPN 's comment sums up my feeling. In PROPN, PROPN) fields come across as string, so PROPN obviously recognized the pain.
1834;positive;Wow! Yeah, I did'nt know that! Great new feature.
1835;negative;I 'm writing an PROPN plugin for the PROPN. I need a functionality that tracks certain strings or regular expressions and possibly creates markers. I know that PROPN already does that for PROPN comments, for example( creating task markers for them) but I 'm not sure if I can use the same mechanism. I can write my own but worried it would be too inefficient and not sensitive enough to code chnanges.
1836;negative;This is a terrible idea, as a compact on a database already in a suspect state can lose data that would otherwise be recoverable before the compact. PROPN On Close should under all circumstances be turned PROPN.
1837;neutral;Update way later: there 's actually a built in function to get the current user. I think it 's in nativeApplication.
1838;neutral;PROPN is a commercial product which has no development history in common with PROPN 's original PROPN PROPN, PROPN. A non- commercial alternative is PROPN.
1839;neutral;what 's their max baudrate for communicating with USB converters? I looked on their website, it says 230400 but I may have misread something.( PROPN 's not enough for my application)
1840;positive;Got some code here that is n't working: Basically I have 3 lists and want to add a class( last) to each item appearing last in each unordered list. Hope that makes sense, PROPN!
1841;negative;This is similar to the accepted answer( because it is using PROPN to represent the newline rather than PROPN) but here the< c: PROPN> PROPN is used to set the attribute: The following snippet also works, but the second line of the< c: PROPN> PROPN can not be indented( and may look uglier ):
1842;negative;PROPN, I 'm trying to get this code from PROPN PROPN 's book to compile in PROPN. It 's actually been taken word for word from the author 's website, though I declared it on .cpp instead of .h( the PROPN file ai n't working with the tester application). The PROPN PROPN& item) function is what 's giving me grief. The compiler error says: What I 'm I missing here?
1843;negative;Restoring splitter distances has given me a lot of grief too. I have found that restoring them from my user settings in the form( or user control) Load event gave much better results than using the constructor. Trying to do it in the constructor gave me all sorts of weird behaviour.
1844;neutral;Any, but PROPN especially loves threads.
1845;neutral;While your basic point is correct, the code you 've shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question: PROPN, you get four` int` in one cache line, that means on average you get a latency of less than 30 cycles to load the data( not considering prefetching), you have conditional jumps in your loop( modern architectures hate mispredicting those), so you get much, much more than a cycle for each loop iteration. I 'd wager, your swap will take at least 100 to 200 cycles, probably more, but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping( how many mispredictions are made).
1846;negative;I guess that works, but I 'd never do that. It 's screaming bad practice. Think about code readability etc .. Come back to your code in six months and figure out all the function calls inside your PROPN markup.
1847;negative;My form receives asynchronous callbacks from another object on random worker threads. I have been passing the data to the main thread( where it can be used to update onscreen controls) using delegates as shown below. Performance is dreadful -- once I reach 500 updates per second, the program completely locks up. My PROPN processing itself is not the problem, as I can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problems. Is there a more efficient mechanism I should be using to hand off the data from thread to thread?
1848;neutral;if the 2 structures variable are initialied with PROPN or they are set with 0 by memset so you can compare your 2 structures with PROPN and there is no worry about structure garbage and this will allow you to earn time
1849;neutral;I am looking at moving my company 's internal business app from PROPN to PROPN. Some of the people were worried about losing PROPN features that can be found in .NET. I am under the impression that with the right javascript framework, anything in .NET PROPN can be replicated. While I am still researching this point, I would like to ask if form features in .NET PROPN can in fact be replicated with javascript and slightly more importantly, will it take much longer to develop to get the same results?
1850;neutral;I have wrist pain when I type and I would like to start writing PROPN statements, stored procedure, and views using speech recognition.
1851;positive;Very direct question, i need to know if its possible and maybe where to start reading about that. I m a programmer with zero experience in windows servers and a client is asking if we can deliver in their windows PROPN no they wo nt let us use any kind of virtualization in them). Thanks guys, i know its not 100% programming related but ... hope you can help =) PROPN: Wow, fast reply! Thanks guys!!!
1852;positive;See here: I tried retrotranslator from 1.6 to 1.4.2 and it works pretty well!
1853;positive;awesome explanation!! this is seriously awesome ..
1854;positive;Does anyone know of a link to a reference on the web that contains a sample PROPN dictionary word script, that can be used to populate a dictionary table in PROPN PROPN? I can handle a .txt or .csv file, or something similar. Alternatively, I 'm adding custom spellchecking functionality to my web apps ... but I do n't want to integrate the standard components. If there are good references( with samples) on building a dictionary word checker, I 'd love that too!
1855;neutral;To further explain: PROPN once had a section in their agreement that specifically listed the allowable programming languages PROPN, PROPN, PROPN- C and PROPN. This was cause for a lot of confusion, doubts and fear. Eventually PROPN stopped naming the languages. I know for a fact that even while this was in place, a variety of apps were on the store, being published, or in development that used PROPN scripting in some way or another.
1856;neutral;reload() does not work." Reloading" is usually implemented by forking. Implementing" real" reload() is extremely difficult and even the most serious attempt, is n't perfect.
1857;neutral;I need to get the current user too, but ca n't find that function ... can you share the solution?
1858;neutral;What can I do to increase the performance/ speed of my PROPN scripts without installing software on my servers?
1859;negative;7 seconds between asking and answering it yourself? Is n't that abusing the system a little?
1860;positive;I did a lot of VRML+Java work in college and loved it, but I feel like it 's not really a marketable skill. Has anyone worked with a high level graphics API like open inventor, coin .. etc that is actually in use to a degree that makes investing a lot of time in the API worthwhile for something more than a hobby?
1861;positive;There 's for a sort that should work, but just was n't included in the core. Referenced from, I think you just pass in a function that is used to sort, like so PROPN it helps!
1862;neutral;PROPN -- from what I 've read, unit tests should not hit the file system, PROPN, or go accross the network. I 'm trying to stick to those rules.
1863;neutral;I have a binary file that I have to parse and I 'm using PROPN. Is there a way to take 4 bytes and convert it to a single precision floating point number?
1864;neutral;This does n't do title case, where small words( articles and prepositions) should not be capitalized.
1865;neutral;It will create a new enumerable, which may not be desirable in some scenarios. You can not sort an PROPN in- place through the interface except by using PROPN. Adapter method in my knowledge.
1866;negative;Another thing I hate to see is the: I 've seen this in real code.
1867;neutral;I have a process in PROPN that is supposed to do something immediately after spawn, then send the result back to the parent when it is finished. How do I figure out the PROPN of the process that spawned it?
1868;neutral;false&& false== false I 'm afraid that you would need to make that the negation of an XOR in order to make it correct.
1869;negative;-5 votes?? People who have downvoted this answer should have specified the reason for doing so as well.
1870;positive;@Adrian- that article was brilliant :D thanks for sharing it!
1871;positive;+1 for splint, excellent tool and free( as in free speech, not as in free beer)
1872;positive;Code samples would be great!
1873;positive;You are Awesome!
1874;positive;As far as I know, and I 'm definately not a hacker, you are completely fine. Really, if someone wanted to, they could exploit your code anyway clientside, but i do n't see how they could exploit your server side code using javascript( unless you use server side javascript)
1875;negative;My application links against PROPN. I am doing this to make distributing the final binary easier. I am worried that perhaps the code inside the .a file depends on some other libraries I also will need to distribute. But if it does n't I am worried I am bloating up my application too much by including multiple copies of PROPN. PROPN. What exactly will be inside PROPN? Just libsamperate 's bytecode? Or more?
1876;neutral;This is a copy of the question: But now is for netbeans( I 'm not a eclipse lover. CTRL+TAB does not change pages.) Please, I 'm very curious.
1877;negative;As a dev I worry about event logs getting full and then hitting an error when logging an error. But I suppose you have to deal with' logging' failures with whatever you are logging to( file/ PROPN).
1878;negative;Not an exact answer I 'm afraid, but this information might help.
1879;neutral;@MarkHarrison: can I use that online?
1880;positive;Great thanks fung! It was especially the" Starting Our PROPN PROPN" section that helped.
1881;positive;I really liked which PROPN however you can easily translate that to C# the author has a web site too.
1882;positive;Excellent. Thanks.
1883;positive;We could, but that 'd mean installing PROPN and so on and so forth. Sometimes PROPN PROPN is fine :-)
1884;negative;When you say it did n't detect it do you really mean you were collecting everything and the packet you wanted was n't there? I find that hard to believe. It does n't need any configuration, it just works. Getting a sensible filter so it gets what you want and not loads of other crap is harder!
1885;negative;I am fed up having to turn them on every time I open the application.
1886;neutral;After doing some more digging and hacking it turns out to not be terribly hard to drop the PROPN interface into an application. It 's not pretty without a lot of work, but it works right away.
1887;neutral;This code is 99% correct. However, if we call Peek or Pop without putting anything on the stack, it will crash as the index is -1. This could be easily fixed by adding index bounds checking.
1888;negative;might be an answer, but I 'm afraid I ca n't speak from experience.
1889;neutral;If I understand this correctly: Current CPU developing companies like PROPN and PROPN have their own API codes( the assembly language) as what they see as the 2 G language on top of the PROPN code( 1 G language) Would it be possible or desirable( performance or otherwise) to have a CPU that would perform PROPN handling at it 's core instead of the current API calls?
1890;neutral;i think by using this code you can have a limited size queue .. which is also Circular buffer.
1891;positive;Excellent pair of web casts( 30 minute videos) where PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN talk through some of the features of PROPN and how to use them:
1892;neutral;is the most comprehensive I 've found, but it suffers from much the same problem you noted in PROPN PROPN. Maybe you can help by updating it with any information you 've found independently?
1893;positive;My work just gave me a quad core computer, and PROPN build times are fast!( What used to take 20+ minutes now takes 7 minutes). Anyway, PROPN PROPN builds project in parallel( great for build times), but scrambles the output: Is there a plugin that sorts the output when the build is complete?
1894;neutral;Is there a standard way to see how much stack space your app has and what the highest watermark for stack usage is during a run? Also in the dreaded case of actual overflow what happens? Does it crash, trigger an exception or signal? Is there a standard or is it different on all systems and compilers? I 'm looking specifically for PROPN, PROPN and PROPN.
1895;positive;This is great, thanks for the tip!
1896;positive;+1 PROPN def. Thanks for the inspiration :) How 's the progress there?
1897;neutral;I 'm afraid that 's not java ;)
1898;positive;Wow! Very simple, but great effect ...
1899;negative;You might want to consider using, a replacement for PROPN' terrible command- line chrome. It offers fully redefinable keyboard shortcuts plus tabs, so it 's ideal for PROPN.
1900;positive;Fantastic that 's exactly what I was looking for!
1901;neutral;The PROPN transcripts are enormous, and sometimes I want to link to a little bit within it. How do I create an PROPN anchor in a PROPN wiki page?
1902;negative;As I 'm a former PROPN programmer that code makes me cringe. Multiple postincrements in PROPN/ PROPN have" undefined behaviour"( i.e. it 's an error, but the compiler wo n't tell you so.) It 's legal in C# and PROPN will always output" 1,2,3" but your PROPN programmer colleagues will hate it.
1903;positive;The( PROPN) is an excellent resource if you 're considering PROPN as a language. It incorporates lots of the stuff you 'd expect in a text processing/ PROPN environment like parsers, stemmers and part- of- speech tagging. Documentation on it is pretty good too. As for datasets, PROPN comes with a variety of for experimenting with. Hope it helps, PROPN
1904;neutral;@SteveKehlet however I believe it is more cleverly referred to as" cat abuse"
1905;negative;Any progress on this one? To embed complex functionality( including history- aware interactivity) on an PROPN page without involving the rest of the page is a reasonable and common desire. The only alternative I see, to require the using page to track each components query- string state, is horrible.
1906;neutral;I 'm writing a simple app that 's going to have a tiny form sitting in one corner of the screen, updating itself. I 'd really love for that form to be transparent and to have the transparency be user- configurable. Is there any easy way to achieve this?
1907;positive;I recently imported about 60k records into a table that relates data in one table to data in another table. However, my client has since requested that a sort order be added to all 60k records. My hope is there is a nice clean way to auto generate these sort orders in a PROPN PROPN. The finished data should look something like this: Can this be done? Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated. --Anne
1908;positive;Excellent question and I agree, it should be throwing an PROPN Not Authorized status.
1909;positive;Ah, finally I can solve this annoying problem!
1910;positive;Excellent answer
1911;negative;I 'm receiving a recovery feed from an exchange for recovering data missed from their primary feed. The exchange strongly recommends listening to the recovery feed only when data is needed, and leaving the multicast once I have recovered the data I need. My question is, if I am using asio, and not reading from the PROPN when I do n't need it, what is the harm? The messages have sequence numbers, so I ca n't accidentally process an old message" left" on the card. Is this really harming my application?
1912;negative;I currently have speakers set up both in my office and in my living room, connected to my PC via two sound cards, and would like to switch the set of speakers I 'm outputting to on the fly. Anyone know an application or a windows API call that I can use to change the default sound output device? It is currently a bit of a pain to traverse the existing control panel system.
1913;neutral;Note you can use PROPN() on non static stuctures without worrying about padding, as long as you do n't initialise all members( at once). This is defined by PROPN:
1914;positive;for flow control PROPN; the question seems to be about whether this pattern should be used, which seems to be rather subjective based on the answers, but it 's an excellent question for thought.
1915;neutral;I 'm talking about. With streaming stackoverflow podcasts and downloading the lastest updates to PROPN, I would like to have QoS working so I can use stackoverflow without my http connections timing out or taking forever. I 'm using an PROPN 624 PROPN modem which has QoS built- in but I ca n't seem to get it to work. Is it even possible to control the downstream( ie. from ISP to your modem)?
1916;neutral;@awied: you also need to worry about the situation in which a user accessibility application is driving your program.
1917;negative;I want to catch all URL 's in the root folder of the url www.example.com The url can not end in a trailing slash, and ca n't contain any slashes at all. so these should pass: PROPN PROPN PROPN** fail! www.example.com/asdfsd/asdf** PROPN!
1918;neutral;If you are getting thrown off by the fact that the user/ group is listed as having" PROPN PROPN" on the PROPN on, say, the parent site/ web. That 's just a placeholder PROPN uses to make sure people have access to at least the bare minimum set of objects( e.g. theme and other PROPN files and the parent web itself) to get to the list or item you actually want them to have access to. As long as the group only has access on a single list, you should have to worry about them having access to anything else.
1919;negative;too bad this behavior is n't a setting. I think it makes sense in theory why they did it this way, but in practice it 's just really annoying
1920;neutral;If PROPN is crashing a lot on you, you might try uninstalling any add- ins and extensions as a first step. It might save you a lot of pain.
1921;positive;Works great!
1922;neutral;Also I would try: But I do n't have PROPN installed so I ca n't really test this ...
1923;negative;i ca n't find it: PROPN
1924;neutral;Has anyone built a website with PROPN and PROPN. What were your experiences and is the combination ready for prime- time?
1925;neutral;Suppose we have a table A: and table B: I want to join A*B on PROPN= B.itemid both right and left ways. i.e. result: Is there a way to do it in one query in PROPN?
1926;neutral;Though be aware that if the starting string is all upper case, you have to call` PROPN. ToLower` first, since` ToTitleCase` does n't work on all upper case strings.
1927;neutral;Becouse the web service is being used to intergrade in with a 3rd party data feed, that the customer wishes to be able to setup without having to wait for the next release of the software. PROPN PROPN can inport data from a web service without PROPN kowning about the PROPN when they wrote PROPN!
1928;neutral;But the question is not as simple as assuming .... But surely this is a PROPN for it question? Pretty much every regex primer you can find anywhere uses PROPN as an example! scores 183,000 hits!
1929;positive;I 'd really love this to work in PROPN. I 'm not able to change the fact that tables should not be used here. PROPN is the only browser the project I 'm working on is required to support. Here 's the code: I 've been using the PROPN PROPN to play with this. Thanks in advance for your help!
1930;positive;I know PROPN has a screen recorder api called that you can access programatically. I have n't used it, but I 've used the snagit api by the same company and it 's excellent.
1931;positive;Your best bet is probably PROPN. There 's a great sample that does exactly what you 're doing right in the .NET PROPN here: Good luck to you!
1932;positive;I realize this is old, but there is an absolutely fabulous PROPN PROPN library called, appropriately, PROPN PROPN. I 've used it for several months and it blows away the other libraries. Check it out:
1933;positive;I second PROPN. You do n't get the visual design stuff for the PROPN, but for the code( both PROPN and PROPN) it 's excellent.
1934;positive;The overlapping part is an excellent point. Its also worth clarifying the question as to which is most common in the case of substrings of varying length.
1935;neutral;Here 's a PROPN solution Here 's a PROPN solution Here 's a PROPN one- liner solution: What the one- liner is doing is using a regular expression substitution of the first character of each word with the uppercase version of it.
1936;positive;I have a query that is simply selecting from 3 tables. select from the comments table for all comments on an article select from PROPN table to find what kind of user it is IF the user is one type, search one table ... ELSE search another table for the final info. How would I go about this? I 'm a little new at PROPN stuff, so i totally appreciate your patience! PROPN- let me know if this is nt clear ... Thanks!
1937;positive;Take a 200th upvote for an excellent question.
1938;positive;Excellent comment, PROPN. My head asplode.
1939;neutral;May want to replace`" \\"` with` File.separator` to make it work on PROPN.
1940;positive;I 'd like to be able to see what registry keys are used for. A book on the registry would be fine as well. Info on PROPN PROPN changes would be great!
1941;negative;The ebook summarises PROPN. PROPN and PROPN. Resume thusly: The deprecated PROPN and PROPN methods have two modes       dangerous and useless! The book recommends using a synchronization construct such as an or to perform thread suspending and resuming.
1942;negative;I tested this code out with an PROPN 2007 database with no exceptions( I went as high as 13000 inserts). However, what I noticed is that it is terribly slow as you are creating a connection every time. If you put the" PROPN)" outside the loop, it goes much faster.
1943;positive;PROPN PROPN here ... trying to work on a project but I 'm stuck. The project is trying to find the miles per gallon per trip then at the end outputting total miles and total gallons used and averaging miles per gallon How do I loop back up to the first question after the first set of questions has been asked. Also how will I average the trips ... will I have to have a variable for each of the trips? I 'm stuck, any help would be great!
1944;positive;totally awesome
1945;negative;If I can avoid it, no. And, to my knowledge, there is always a way to avoid it. But I 'm not stating that it 's totally useless either
1946;positive;Strange- No one mentioned PROPN( PROPN) or PROPN( PROPN, PROPN, PROPN/ PROPN ...). Both of them are great! PROPN especially deals with tabs and spaces very well. And- it 's free. Whee! When I need a lighter weight thingy, I just use PROPN. PROPN PROPN here-
1947;negative;I am suffering from the problem in the first example- my enums do n't show up at all. This answer does n't even attempt to address that issue.
1948;negative;I just came across this PROPN in some open- source PROPN, and I choked on my drink. Rather than: or even: the code read: I can see this is the same result, but is this a typical idiom in PROPN? If so, is it some performance hack that runs fast? Or is it just a once- off that needs a code review?
1949;neutral;No, I never did figure it out- good luck!
1950;positive;Both of these answers were really helpful- thanks!
1951;positive;Take a look at[ this answer](   Hope it helps!
1952;positive;PROPN led me to solution( PROPN). Hope this helps!
1953;neutral;Actually it does n't even have to be malicious code. It could just be a accidental name collision.
1954;positive;I 'm new to developing web applications using the .NET framework. I 'm just wondering if .NET has any support for saving a custom int value for each( logged in) user? Could I perhaps use the PROPN. User property or something? I 'd be really grateful for some help on this! /Ylva
1955;negative;PROPN is a horrible option for performing replaces on a large amount of text. As powerful as it is, many PROPN proponents see all the world as a nail and PROPN as their hammer. For use cases involving large amounts of text, look at PROPN
1956;neutral;PROPN: what 's so horrible with using ajax and query string to update parts of a page?
1957;positive;PROPN PROPN( author of the second link above) has a longer article which is excellent:
1958;positive;I 'm building a marketplace application that uses PROPN PROPN. I 've got a form for sellers to input their PROPN API credentials, but I need a way to validate them by making some sort of call to PROPN. I 'm using the PROPN in PROPN, and I do n't see anything other than the standard purchase controls. Is there any sort of null- operation that can be used? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
1959;neutral;If you are not forced to use a particular compiler I suggest to use PROPN and in the new 5.3 version you will find a class dedicated to serial ports: The code you will write will run on all supprited PROPN platforms, at least those that have serial ports.
1960;negative;I have a .net assembly that has a COM+ PROPN in it and at the moment I install it into the PROPN to get everything working. This means that I need to have every assembly that it references in the PROPN as well. During development it is quite painful to make changes to thes assemblies, re- install them to the PROPN and then test. Is it possible to maintain the COM+ component but not have everything in the GAC?
1961;neutral;Make sure that the file has svn: keywords" PROPN PROPN PROPN" and then put$ PROPN somewhere in there. See.
1962;neutral;I lost my MySQL username and password. How do I retrieve it?
1963;positive;awesome- what started off as a gripe turned into a real educational experience- thanks everyone!
1964;neutral;I 've knocked up a basic version of what I 'm looking for, it 's not perfect but it 'll do the job until something better comes along.
1965;positive;Too awesome! This actually answered an unasked question of mine, how to stop people from cutting off others in my corporate meeting.
1966;neutral;Use case for me: So I can compare objects against a PROPN PROPN PROPN without worrying about how they typed the fields.( I am comparing an object against a compact database where some fields are name PROPN and PROPN.) In other words, for sake of laziness.
1967;positive;Creating custom types can be done in PROPN. PROPN PROPN actually has two great posts that detail the process thoroughly. The book also has a code sample for creating a domain specific language to create custom types. The book is excellent all around, so I really recommend it. If you are just looking for a quick way to do the above, you could create a function to create the custom object like
1968;positive;Great point- will change!
1969;negative;PROPN- can you revue the accepted answer. You have to scroll a long way to get to a[ pure javascript answer](   and I fear some users just take the accepted answer as gospel and use antiquated libraries as a result.
1970;neutral;@Cocowalla: the finalizer should dispose the unmanaged mutexes unless it ca n't know if the mutex was created by the managed app or attached to an existing one.
1971;neutral;do nt mark this guy down. technically he is correct    IoC is a very general principal. Flow of control is" inverted" by dependency injection because you have effectively delegated dependancies to some external system( e.g. PROPN container)
1972;neutral;It 's generally better to keep them open. If you 're concerned about being able to read them from another process, you need make sure that the share mode you use to open/ create them allows others to read them( but not write to them, obviously). If you 're worried about losing data in the event of a crash, you should periodically flush/ commit their buffers.
1973;negative;List comprehension performance link is dead :(
1974;positive;Thanks djuth, this works great and is very simple! I have to admit it is pretty limiting though, for example, I would love to have it autocomplete a staff name and then return a PROPN but I can probably play around with what 's added and parsed.
1975;positive;Are there any tools to assist with the internationalization of Strings within PROPN files? Most PROPN( for example,) offer such a feature for PROPN code. However, in the case of PROPN, no such feature exists for PROPN files. With, for example, there is are various tools out there that assist with extracting text Strings from code. Something similar for PROPN would be great!
1976;neutral;You could use PROPN to get the PROPN of the window, then use the PROPN function found in the PROPN PROPN.
1977;neutral;Are you really sure you need to use a cursor? Those are not supposed to be the first choice in PROPN PROPN these days. In fact, many experts abhor them.
1978;negative;This is a problem with PROPN PROPN that is very annoying from its introduction. And persist trough several versions of windows. I have two questions: Is it possible to be disabled or at least require confirmation in XP/2003 PROPN? Does PROPN handles this in Vista/2008 server? If it does not- is there any way to disable it?
1979;positive;Thank you PROPN, I suppose this 'll have to do. I would 've liked a more concise solution but thank you anyway, I never knew this PROPN- PROPN class existed!
1980;negative;I need to pass a regex substitution as a variable: This, of course, does n't work. I tried eval'ing the substitution: but that did n't work either. What horribly obvious thing am I missing here?
1981;negative;This was annoyingly annoying ... If you have a the need to export your PROPN history you can take a look at, which prints to the console your history, also as PROPN.
1982;positive;Great question!
1983;neutral;How do I code for a company icon to appear on the left- side next to the URL address in the browser 's address bar?
1984;negative;/me works out more what your code does and screams in agony.
1985;neutral;I have a session where they are, in fact, getting mixed up.
1986;neutral;This does n't do title case, where small words( articles and prepositions) should not be capitalized.
1987;neutral;Wow! I always thought double quotes were required!
1988;neutral;Unfortunately if you want to make this an open API, many people will be unable to use PROPN- Type headers. The sad reality is that you usually need to allow some hacks, even if you permit the standardized way too.
1989;neutral;I 've got a really simple powershell script( see below). I 've got PROPN aliased using the following in my profile: In powershell I simply: This returns successfully.( PROPN/ Commit both complete successfully). Yet when I check the registry, or in powershell using get- pssnapin -registered it does n't show my assembly. I did this the other day and it worked fine, but I do n't seem to be able to duplicate it ... please advise.}
1990;neutral;Apparently there 's the very obvious" PROPN" property which I completely missed!
1991;neutral;anyone have any experience of using them together? How well does it work? or is it just too much grief?
1992;positive;Tried it, loved it. Using it right now.
1993;positive;+1 for PROPN. It has never ever limited me in any way. It does have a learning curve, but once you get to know the basics of the system, you 'll be amazed what things can be done in a short period of time. Also, great supporting community!
1994;neutral;Just a general FYI: It is[ almost* always* better](   to simply` throw;` instead of` throw e;`
1995;positive;PROPN+ latest PROPN+ latest xdebug.dll works fine!
1996;neutral;When opening PROPN PROPN PROPN, whether it be through PROPN or finder, the introductory dialog is shown. Is there a way to not show this dialog without already having checked the" Do n't Show Again" option when opening a document using PROPN? PROPN and PROPN PROPN libraries have ways of setting interaction levels and not showing dialogs, but I ca n't seem to find the option in PROPN.
1997;negative;Using it is painfully easy to access movies from the PROPN site: However I see no way to get the picture or thumbnail of the movie cover. Suggestions?
1998;neutral;Give her full access, if she wants it. She 's supposed to manage the project you are developing, and to do that efficiently, she might need to be able to look at any part of the project. Of course, there 's always danger that she might do something stupid or malicious. If you have as part of your process auditing of any changes, you 'll be able to find out if she messes anything.
1999;positive;I love the way you assimilated another answer!
2000;positive;( PROPN PROPN PROPN) is fairly clever if all your server/ clients are going to be in PROPN. I use alot though since I 'm communicating with hosts that are not always PROPN. PROPN lends itself to being extended fairly easily too. There is an excellent PROPN library for python called which is reasonably up to date and has no dependancy on PROPN.
2001;positive;Excellent method for minor changes. Just what I was looking for. Thank you.
2002;neutral;How can I get programmatic access to the call stack?
2003;positive;Have you tried logging into PROPN as your installed PROPN user then When you log in you 'll be able to change your password. Good luck :)
2004;positive;Just a personal opinion, not an actual answer but ... I love those login forms( not pages) which just shows up in the center of the page and after you type in your username and password you are logged in without ever leaving the current page!
2005;negative;IMO it is painful to debug as you tend to have no intermediary variables for inspection.
2006;negative;no, it is extremely bad idea.
2007;negative;Is there a way to run a specific PROPN task via the keyboard? I have a rsync to dev task that I run a lot and running to the mouse to double- click is a pain.
2008;neutral;in our continuous integration setup we use SVNRevisionLabeller and pass the variables from this to PROPN to use when creating the compiled website PROPN. It 's then available to .NET using GetCurrentAssembly() in the final build.
2009;neutral;This is flat wrong I 'm afraid- you should follow PROPN guidelines:   - PROPN should not be formed on readability or on making it" compact"- but rather using elements or attributes correctly for the purpose which they were designed for.
2010;positive;I hope PROPN favors the brave :)
2011;negative;I have a column containing the strings' PROPN( 1)' and so on until' PROPN( 600)' so far. I want to get them numerically ordered and I 've come up with which is very very ugly. Better suggestions?
2012;positive;I would say yes, it was PROPN PROPN 's intent to make the observer pattern a first- class language feature with events in C#, based on his experience with PROPN. PROPN makes this and other design intentions clear in an excellent interview on.
2013;negative;-1 This is n't language agnostic.
2014;positive;An excellent book I have, which covers this topic, is, by PROPN PROPN. It has got many good explanations and good ideas on how to decouple your business layer from the persistence layer. You really should give it a try. It 's one of my favorite books.
2015;negative;I see PROPN is still at it with their horrible magic version control stuff ...
2016;neutral;I would avoid it for module globals certainly. For variables restricted to local scope, so you can see the same function is n't ever going to need to use the builtin, it 's not something I 'd worry about.
2017;neutral;Why do you believe that" template metaprogramming is all the rage"?
2018;positive;If you 're looking for a free alternative to PROPN PROPN 's most excellent PROPN PROPN, you might want to check PROPN made by. It 's what I used until I caved and bought PROPN PROPN.
2019;neutral;I 'm afraid it ca n't be done, the psudo- class selectors ca n't be set in- line, you 'll have to do it on the page or on a stylesheet. I should mention that technically you should be able to do it, but most browsers do n't support it PROPN: I just did a quick test with this: And it does n't work in PROPN, PROPN beta 2, PROPN or PROPN. Can anyone else test in any other browsers?
2020;neutral;As PROPN said. Simply load the main game assembly in to PROPN PROPN and try to compile it. It wo n't if you try to make a reference to an assembly outside the those that ship with the 360.
2021;neutral;Not available in silverlight. See other C# answer(s)
2022;neutral;How can I find the high water mark( the historical maximum number of concurrent users) in an oracle database( PROPN).
2023;negative;more than 7? How about more than 2 or 3? Remembering the argument ordering in constructors is a real pain.
2024;negative;Background: I 'm currently debugging an application written over a custom- built PROPN framework in PROPN. I 've managed to pin down most bugs, but the bugs I 'm having the most trouble with tend to have a common theme. All of them seem to be to do with the screen refreshing, redrawing or updating to match provided data. This is a pain to debug, because I ca n't break on every refresh, and most of this stuff is time- sensitive, so breakpoints occasionally" fix" the bug. Q: Does anyone have any tips for debugging PROPN- based GUIs, especially regarding the refreshing of individual components?
2025;neutral;Is the local server on your dev pc being accessed by name or PROPN address. The issue could be related DNS resolution.
2026;neutral;For PROPN and other processes using` PROPN`, see[ How to find the supervisor of an PROPN process?](
2027;positive;I always seem to use Get when working with data( strongly typed or otherwise) from the database and I have never really needed to use PROPN although I just as easily could use PROPN instead of get when pulling out and updating data. Can anyone provide guidance as to the implications and gotchas of each method? In what situations is it preferable to use one or the other? Any performance implications? Thanks in advance for the answers! I love this community!
2028;neutral;Here 's an implementation in PROPN: And a port of this implementation that I 've just done in PROPN:
2029;positive;Designing with Web PROPN is a great first read!
2030;neutral;also check out the project at codeplex which is a tutorial of sorts on parallelization using .net among other things:
2031;positive;six more years and still loving it.
2032;neutral;I 'm new to development( an admin by trade) and I 'm setting up my development environment and I would like to set up a PROPN. Net server on PROPN 2008. A quick PROPN did not turn up any instructions for getting it running on PROPN 7.0, so I was wondering if anyone had experience getting this set up.
2033;positive;Congratulations on the new job! Relax and keep your cool. Read something on. I guess, the process itself will make sure you are productive as long as you apply common sense :)
2034;neutral;We 're in the process of packaging combinations of our products/ modules. Some of them are stand- alone some are interdependent. All versions must be deployable side- by- side. As it is we 're considering two choices: One MSI per package and version One MSI per product/ module and version The first alternative would mean that combinations of the same merge modules would be delivered in several packages. The second alternative represents the simpler path. Can you give some advice on the subject? Will any of the alternatives cause grief in the longer run?
2035;neutral;Yep. I gave up actively deleting stuff off my hard drive a long time ago. Just like with gmail, with decent search it 's easier to just archive everything rather than worry about sorting, filing, and deleting it.
2036;neutral;That 's exactly the point- PROPN does not protect you against mistakes. Of course, the programmer expected somevar to contain 23- its just that nasty attacker that decided to shove a blank in ...
2037;neutral;Here is the equivalent PROPN prototype for the PROPN function: int PROPN* PROPN, int PROPN); Nothing earth- shattering, but maybe it will get an answer from someone afraid to contribute because of unfamiliarity with PROPN.
2038;neutral;I have a PROPN application that 's very String- heavy- it takes a feed of huge numbers of big, different String objects. Do I need to worry about the PROPN PROPN PROPN for memory and performance? Is there any way to see how big the pool is at any point?
2039;negative;Sorting the hashes is also a possibility that I have considered. I 'm a bit concerned about memory usage, but I 'll worry about that later.
2040;neutral;The reason to build it into the language is that it can get painful when you want a hierarchy of chainable objects that return the most derived type. Currently, you have to have`` generics to allow subclasses to change the return type so calling methods do n't lose scope of the object they are calling. Building into the jvm removes this ugliness. Plus, instead of a return statement, it can just push a reference to this on the stack as needed; an" on demand return" instead of an" always return" that can be hard to optimize out when you do n't use it.
2041;positive;I found a library that makes it easy to get my oAuth_token and PROPN with c#. If I 'm trying to make a POST to a RESTful web service( ie.) how are those two keys leveraged to varify authentication. A C# example would be awesome!
2042;negative;I 've been trimming the PROPN of our website by doing the following in the onload event of that control: This has become very tedious because there are so many controls to check again and again. As soon as I get it all working, designers request to change the PROPN and then it starts all over. Any suggestions?
2043;positive;I agree. It 's clear that you are on the threshold of either using a library or writing your own. Go get PROPN and just use it as you see fit in your project, starting with this. Here 's to happier days!
2044;neutral;but( early optimization== PROPN))!=( Performance doesen't matter)
2045;neutral;Probably your answer is better given as a comment.
2046;negative;That 's horrible.
2047;neutral;AT what stage are you populating the PROPN? I fear you are doing it too late to be persisted in the page, if PROPN is not somehow disabled.
2048;negative;We ended up using a PROPN applet. It was a nightmare. Normally it would have been awful, but as this was for the 2008 PROPN PROPN, the added distance& language differences made it a nightmare. In the end, it worked" enough." But again, nightmare. I would not recommend it.
2049;negative;Dude I feel your pain. I used my blogger address but since moved my blog. I do n't want to continue using my blogger address as my i PROPN now there is a PROPN option.
2050;positive;Do n't forget about! JSON seems to have better support though. For example, the library has excellent built- in JSON functions.
2051;neutral;I need the name of the current logged in user in my PROPN/ PROPN application. The application will only be deployed on PROPN machines. I think I could attain this by regexing the PROPN directory, but am open to other ways.
2052;negative;If someone is commonly needing to delete all but the top n rows, I 'd argue they 've got bigger issues to worry about.
2053;negative;I know I can configure command line arguments in the PROPN configuration but I want to run a java file multiple times with different command line arguments. It 's a pain to change the PROPN PROPN every time. Is there a way I can make Eclipse prompt me for command line arguments every time I run the program?
2054;positive;Pretty new to this scene and trying to find some documentation to adopt best practices. We 're building a fairly large content site which will consist of various media catalogs and I 'm trying to find some comparable data/ architectural models so that we can get a better idea of the approach we should use using a framework we 've never made use of before. Any insight/ help would be greatly appreciated!
2055;positive;+1 The perfect enhancement for remote PROPN PROPN PROPN! Love this tool, super fast usage and deleting workflows as well!
2056;negative;PROPN, just realized something ... there 's no way for me to specify a max length when using PROPN. String(sbyte*) which basically means death to using the constructor for the purpose of reading out of a ring- buffer since it could keep reading past the PROPN length into the next segment!
2057;negative;What we have now come up with is halfway what I wanted. Basically we used PROPN to call upon native PROPN PROPN control( the one used by PROPN)- this way we do n't have to worry about nasty PROPN deployment issues, but still it 's a hack
2058;positive;PROPN, great question!
2059;neutral;There is nothing mentioned in
2060;positive;Perhaps I 'm missing something with the concept of PROPN PROPN, but I can not gain access to the PROPN PROPN within the PROPN PROPN as defined here:. Using the following code excerpt: I can only gain access to the" standard" PROPN methods( PROPN, PROPN, PROPN, etc) but can not gain access to the extension methods( Aggregate, All, Any, etc). Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
2061;negative;@Anyone who uses PROPN- Is it 200 MB per project or 200 MB per account? If it 's per account, then that 's awfully small.
2062;positive;I would recommend -- it 's an excellent PROPN with great built- in translation.
2063;neutral;@Pangea it 's* PROPN*
2064;neutral;I have n't touched sharepoint in years. If I want to setup a development environment to get up to speed, what options do I have? I do n't have an PROPN license, is there anyway I can get up and running for free?( for development only)
2065;neutral;Performance is very rarely a motivating factor in the choice of a loop.
2066;positive;That 's a great link! PROPN caching, when using the WebFormViewEngine also works with the declarative control too.
2067;negative;It is extremely unreliable and if there are constant builds going you never know the actual build is broke.
2068;positive;Interesting idea. Best of luck!
2069;positive;Very useful thankyou!
2070;negative;I 'm doing a fair bit of work in PROPN recently, and using Is absolutely critical. However, I 'm really disappointed with the default PROPN console in PROPN, especially in that there 's a really annoying bug where moving the cursor back when at the bottom of the screen irregularly causes it to jump back. Anyone have a decent console app they use in PROPN?
2071;negative;I have a screen with say 20 controls on it. I want to show all twenty, then hide only the ones that do n't relate to what I 'm working on. My problem is that between the loops the screen paints. It looks very ugly. I know I 've seen this done but for the life of me I ca n't find that code, or even remember what app I 'd seen that code in .. Does anyone know how to suspend the paint for a bit?
2072;neutral;Works for me on PROPN 7
2073;neutral;Suggest adding the following to Peek and PROPN( ): if((_ stack. PROPN- 1)< 0) throw new Exception("Cannot Peek or PROPN without first doing a Push.");. This would alert the programmer to this corner case, and allow them to keep it in mind when using this class. We could also add a PROPN or PROPN, which is the approach PROPN have taken with their PROPN implementations.
2074;neutral;We need to test a website in both PROPN and PROPN. We 've had bugs appear running on actual windows machines that are n't visible under vmware(?!), so we have an actual windows laptop to do this- but only one. Is it possible to install PROPN and PROPN side- by- side in such a way that they absolutely, positively, behave exactly like they would if there was only one of them? How?
2075;positive;This is awesome!
2076;neutral;We 've been using a combination of PROPN PROPN for the codebase usenet PROPN based system As long as there is a PROPN search appliance pointed at these things I think it 's ok to have any or many versions as long as people use them
2077;neutral;If I have a simple piece of data to store( an integer or string for example) I might choose to store that in PROPN, or using a PROPN control. Why would I choose one over the other? PROPN PROPN for the user to PROPN( thought not impossible), which might be desirable PROPN PROPN can be used in PROPN Are there other pros and cons?

2080;neutral;Using the PROPN PROPN, how can I get a list of domains on my network?
2081;positive;this works super for me!( no pun intended)
2082;neutral;I would not store configuration information in the repository at all. That way you do n't have to worry about PROPN trying to update the config when you update your source.
2083;positive;This is great! I figured I just had to redrag everything into the dbml.
2084;positive;once again, i just want to comment on this- great suggestion!
2085;negative;Is there a way to set" work offline" in PROPN without having to try opening a solution, waiting for it to time out, and then having PROPN PROPN work out that it has failed? It seems a touch ridiculous that I ca n't just tick a box to tell it myself, seeing as I 'm probably the one most qualified to know when I 'm not in the office!

2089;negative;PROPN Two different control statements just to appease developers who want their switch statements to work in a slightly different way? That 's a** terrible** idea. PROPN[ had that mentality for loops](   and it worked out terribly.
2090;negative;I 'm trying to bring a legacy C# .NET 1.1 application into the modern era. We use PROPN for our collections of what could have been business objects. Given that most of the code thinks it is talking to the interface of a PROPN, what generic collection would make for the least painful transition?
2091;positive;is a metadata management system developed on the PROPN PROPN platform that heavily leverages PROPN, PROPN, and PROPN. It has some big customers in the broadcast space and is an excellent example of enterprise use of these technologies.

2098;neutral;first question here. I 'm developing a program in C#( .NET 3.5) that displays files in a listview. I 'd like to have the" large icon" view display the icon that PROPN PROPN uses for that filetype, otherwise I 'll have to use some existing code like this: The above code returns an integer that is used to select an icon from an imagelist that I populated with some common icons. It works fine but I 'd need to add every extension under the sun! Is there a better way? Thanks!
2099;neutral;There seem to be many excellent web frameworks for PROPN. Has anyone used any of these( PROPN, PROPN, PROPN) with PROPN?

I hate programs which do n't even let you look at the logfile while they are running, or where the log file is n't flushed and lags behind what is happening.
2101;positive;PROPN, One of the best recommendations I can make is to read the relevant PROPN) of PROPN PROPN 's PROPN PROPN(). He has an excellent discussion on naming techniques. HTH cheers, PROPN
2102;neutral;How do I format a string to title case?
2103;positive;There 's lots of things that I do n't know about languages and syntax. +1 because I learned that you can make a setter private inside a public property. Awesomeness ensues!
2104;neutral;You can try the PROPN function to not steal focus. I have n't used it, but it seems to be what you 're looking for.
2105;negative;PROPN may be more of a pain than it is worth. PROPN PROPN claims it works with custom components but I have found this is not the case. Anything with a renderer seems to have serious problems. It is a lot harder to set up tests than they claim and the tests are n't stable. I have written tests for one component 5 times now using hardcoded ids. Sometimes it just ca n't see the component and it dies. They only have 3 short paragraphs explaining tests in their user guide and they only respond to questions about how to set it up on their google group. I would avoid using this.
2106;neutral;@Gili: PROPN is in current production use by our customers.
2107;negative;What you are asking is inherently impossible. The game runs on the client and is therefore completely at the user 's mercy. Only way to be sure is running a real time simulation of the game on the server based on user 's input( mouse movement, keypresses), which is absolutely ridiculous.
2108;positive;Thanks for the recommendation. I 've just talked to them and I 'm getting a demo. It looks good on paper, I really hope its can handle what I 'm looking for.
2109;neutral;Sometimes you re developing and you decide to commit, forgetting you created a few files on your project. Then a few days down the line your buddy gets your build out of subversion and complains that some files appear to be missing. You realize, ah crap, I forgot to add those files! How can I get a list of the files that are not under version control from subversion so I 'm sure I 've added everything to the repository?
2110;positive;PROPN( after version PROPN, anyway) will let you map incoming connections in the PROPN configuration. There 's an excellent tutorial on that describes the steps to configure port mapping.
2111;neutral;See also on PROPN. PROPN:[ Why is PROPN of PROPN named that way?](
2112;negative;Um ... Nothing ... Sad that we all missed the simple solution.
2113;positive;I would be extremely appreciative if anybody can help me. I am learning PROPN and I have been trying figure this one out. Basically, PROPN PROPN PROPN does not come with the PROPN template. What other way can I go about creating this file? Is there a parameter I can set in PROPN so that the linker can create this on the fly? Thanks!!!
2114;negative;I thought I 'd commented. Complete rubbish  # 6692107
2115;positive;askgeo.com is fantastic, thanks!
2116;neutral;I know this is an old thread. But, posting here anyway. Check out this pdc session:
2117;negative;Because the ORDER BY PROPN() method is terrible for performance. Note that he has 120,000 rows in his table.
2118;neutral;Sure all code can be made better in the future, if you are up to it. But when I make reusable code, I expect that I can just take it into use later without needing to worry about things.
2119;neutral;onload() event is not firing in PROPN when back button is clicked
2120;negative;I 'm afraid I ca n't entirely follow your question- do you want to have a sign up form for membership or email notifications shown as an article? If so, then the easiest way is to install' PROPN'- the' module to component' component. Then you can put any module( ie the sign up PROPN) in the centre content area. The PROPN component can be found here:
2121;positive;Have you actually implemented this successfully? It sounds like a great solution!
2122;negative;Just run, run away screaming .....
2123;positive;Press CTRL+C and keep on processng PROPN. PROPN was killed for me .... :) PROPN 12.04
2124;neutral;Have you compared with` PROPN. PROPN()`?
2125;negative;Trying to get PROPN PROPN working on PROPN is quite a pain. Still struggling with that.
2126;negative;I wish i knew, I am on 3+ projects and have to do 3+ PROPN a day.: cry:
2127;neutral;Voting to close, the question I linked back to should have everything you need.
2128;neutral;One potentially valid reason to impose some maximum password length is that the process of hashing it( due to the use of a slow hashing function such as PROPN) takes up too much time; something that could be abused in order to execute a PROPN attack against the server. Then again, servers should be configured to automatically drop request handlers that take too long. So I doubt this would be much of a problem.
2129;neutral;Do you have any experience of designing a Real Shared- PROPN PROPN? Would you have some readings to recommend me?
2130;neutral;Consider using a[ temporal database](  " PROPN entry").
2131;neutral;What 's the solution that worked for you?
2132;neutral;You just need the to handle the QoS on PROPN boxen. However I would n't expect that much from it because of the results I obtained and.
2133;positive;Agreed. Excellent question.
2134;negative;If I plan to use data caching do I have to worry about conflicts when also using deferred loading? It seems that with PROPN i am losing control of my data.
2135;negative;Is it possible to hide .svn files in the PROPN PROPN dialog( PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN R) of PROPN? It 's very annoying when you have hundreds of files ... Cheers.
2136;negative;This question is awfully vague .. and does n't seem to have anything to do with programming ..
2137;negative;Ignoring how ridiculously lame it is to ask a question and answer it in this fashion seconds later, this is an awful answer, and that is why it is voted down. Why will you only see a small speedup? Can you provide numbers? Platforms tested on? This answer is even more vague than the original question, which was vague to begin with.
2138;negative;Yes, we used to use Starling. But it 's a pain to always delegate the stuff that could take awhile to a different process.
2139;positive;Thanks -- good answers. This is, in fact, a PROPN type; I had to typecast" stoptime" as: Minor point. It works great!
2140;negative;The 1024 byte limit is part of the syslog( section 4.1), as is PROPN transport which does n't have guaranteed delivery( in case you worry about log lines lost in the ether). I think syslog- PROPN can solve both these issues, but I 'm not a syslog expert.
2141;negative;because it is terribly difficult to get right. But I mention` boost::iterator_facade`.
2142;neutral;Use PROPN PROPN api or sax for xml parsing. Give more concrete xml structure.
2143;neutral;A database is meant to manage large volumes of data, and are supposed to give you fast access to read and write that data in spite of the size. Put simply, they manage scale for data- scale that you do n't want to deal with. If you have only a few users( hundreds?), you could just as easily manage the data on disk( say PROPN?) and keep the data in memory. The images should clearly not go in to the database so the question is how much data, or for how many users are you maintaining this database instance?
2144;positive;Source control, keep it offsite and keep it for life! You 'll never have to worry about it.
2145;neutral;I recommend you take a look at how merlin does it, as suggested by PROPN PROPN, e.g.  # PROPN starts a process, and  # PROPN sends a command to the ocaml merlin process, with an async handler.
2146;negative;Why do so many people not understand the importance of permanent URLs?? Even PROPN, selling products to build web applications, regularly fails at this!
2147;positive;I use and to embed the code formatting portions. Works great for me! :-) PROPN page:
2148;positive;PROPN is a great one, they seem to have mastered the physics. See these links for more info: Good luck!
2149;neutral;Why not Double. PROPN?
2150;neutral;I have a situation where PROPN hangs accessing my web app. Based on the excellent from, I installed PROPN to download the PROPN symbols, setup PROPN PROPN to use those symbols, and then used PROPN PROPN to get a stack trace for the hung thread. I have pasted the stack trace below. Does someone more familiar with the PROPN internals have an idea of what is happening, or a suggestion on how to progress with this?
2151;negative;I know that PROPN is the interface and PROPN is the concrete type but I still do n't know when to use each one. What I 'm doing now is if I do n't need the PROPN or PROPN methods I use the interface. Am I right? Is there a better way to decide when to use the interface or the concrete type?
2152;neutral;How do you manage deploying PROPN forms to different sharepoint servers? Is there a better way to deal all the data connections being site- specific without opening the forms, editing the data connections and republishing for each environment?
2153;positive;has a good website PROPN to sql. If anyone wants a book, the first several chapters of book are an excellent intro. Much better than the text book from my database class. If anyone wants to explore relational database concepts, seems to have a good intro. book is also very good on that subject.
2154;negative;According to the documentation in PROPN the PROPN function returns a variant, but Mid$ returns a string and apparently this is more efficient. My questions are: What simple test can I use to discern the difference in performance? I tried looking at simple app which did a few string operations, with, but there was no discernible difference. Is it worth worrying about? I 've gotten into the habit of using the$ -ized functions, but should I recommend everybody on my team to use it as well?
2155;positive;Check out It does the" THIS IS NOT A PROPN PROPN" napkin view very well and is easy to use. Has a full featured you can try out online and as an added bonus you can email your XML to your client and they can tweak it and play with it and email it back to you without having to have a license.
2156;positive;I 've used PROPN for such things in the past with great success.
2157;positive;I love you dude! PROPN Saved me a lot of time.
2158;positive;Wow! Awesome responses- I 'll have to try'em out after work today, and I 'll let y' all know how it goes :)
2159;positive;I always recommend for a good starting point for beginners- especially those who have seen PROPN but never understood how to build up a query them selves or how they work. All PROPN 's books are great. PROPN 's PROPN PROPN book is good. PROPN PROPN 's books are also excellent.
2160;neutral;I am seeking excellent examples of PROPN DSLs( PROPN PROPN PROPN). Which repositories, projects do you know of that are worth a read? Why is it( or: are they) great examples? I am particularly interested in more complex examples that are well thought- out and designed.
2161;positive;I have a small application that I am building a PROPN application into, so far I have the functionality to post messages! I do n't need a login as there will only be a small number of users and I will use their windows username for identification. Has anyone done anything similiar? What else do I need to add? It does n't need to be all singing and dancing as it is just for use within a small development team. Any ideas would be great! Thanks
2162;positive;I am using PROPN PROPN 2.5 with self- servicing. If I want to add some rows into my tables within a transaction and then update the first row I added, do I have to add that first entity into the transaction object again? Here is a fictional example of what I mean: Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
2163;negative;Makes sense, and it 's very similiar to what I am doing. One ant task for stage and one for production, and just using the defaults for local development. But pain arises from mainting 3 different applicationcontexts which have almost identical content ..
2164;positive;PROPN, the creator of PROPN is actually still actively working on it. Have you tried sending him an e- mail? In my experience, he 's very helpful!
2165;neutral;I have a generator and I would like to know if I can use it without having to worry about PROPN, and I would like to use it without the. I would like to use it with a while statement for example( or other constructs). How could I do that?
2166;positive;Other 's have posted equally viable options, so really pick the one that makes the code prettiest to you! :-)
2167;positive;Does anyone know how to add an item to a list but do it so it 's ordered alphabetically using PROPN? I 've got the following code that just adds an item from a dropdown to the end of the list: but I 'd like to be able to insert it in its appropriate place instead of just appending to the end of the existing list. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks!
2168;negative;can talk a bit more about the not so normal .net experience? I was thinking to go for PROPN ...
2169;positive;It may be worth taking a look at, it 's a generic collection library for .NET which includes sets. Note that I have n't looked into it much, but it seems to be a pretty fantastic collection library.
2170;positive;By clever, I mean NOT TO upload once again the files that has been already uploaded( with the same dates, size or checksum ...). It would be great, because the Publish method takes a lot of time!
2171;neutral;Why would you return an PROPN in the first place? From a PROPN service?
2172;neutral;I 'm reasonably certain you ca n't shift focus to another tab. My understanding is this is done to somewhat limit pop ups and other malicious content from stealing the users focus.
2173;negative;I 'm afraid that I already know the answer to my question, but I 'll ask it anyway: When there are two PROPN PROPN servers, can I access data that is stored on the other server? In other words: Can I somehow do this: Is the answer really as short as" No"?
2174;positive;I know its possible to accept a list of objects as a parameter but what about a list of PROPN from checkboxes? This is a bit different as the only name you get has to be the PROPN. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
2175;positive;Very nice work!
2176;positive;I 'm loving.
2177;positive;You should give a try. I have n't tested it but they mention that is works with PROPN PROPN apps and even give you a tutorial. It 's commercial software, but a 30 day trial is available.
2178;neutral;How do I create a self signed PROPN certificate for an PROPN PROPN to use while testing a web app?
2179;neutral;Do you how to do this using an PROPN PROPN? I have n't been able to figure out how to reference an PROPN PROPN in an expression.
2180;positive;Oh, but[ requests](   PROPN is* especially great. imho
2181;positive;Span? That reminds me of a PROPN PROPN ..." PROPN, lovely PROPN, wonderful PROPN!"
2182;neutral;Checkout this[ answer](# 17467) to a similar question.
2183;neutral;In PROPN, how would I apply multiple styles to a? For instance, I have a control which already has a style. I also have a separate style which I would like to add to it without blowing away the first one. The styles have different TargetTypes, so I ca n't just extend one with the other.
2184;positive;That 's an excellent idea PROPN. Thanks!
2185;positive;To add on to PROPN 's excellent post:[ here](   a link that explains how to achieve FLL for g++ -- this may give you some additional insights.
2186;negative;Hi all I have a horrid database I got ta work with and linq to sql is the option i m taking to retrieve data from. PROPN i m trying to reuse a function by throwing in a different table name based on a user selection and there is no way to my knowledge to modify the PROPN or PROPN<> in a PROPN PROPN. This is my current code. I want to populate my PROPN with Enumerable records.
2187;negative;A unit test should do the same thing every time that it runs, otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fails occasionally, and that could be a real pain to debug. Try seeding your pseudo- randomizer with the same seed every time( in the test, that is -- not in production code). That way your test will generate the same set of inputs every time. If you ca n't control the seed and there is no way to prevent the function you are testing from being randomized, then I guess you are stuck with an unpredictable unit test. :(
2188;neutral;@Imad Alazani: The flow of control has been" inverted" by PROPN PROPN( PROPN)
2189;negative;I have a few classes which do nothing except in their constructors/ destructors. Here 's an example I 'm a little concerned about future readability. Am I being too" tricksy" here, with a variable(" busy") which is never actually used in the code? Could some static analysis tool suggest they be removed, or is this PROPN sufficiently common not to worry about?
2190;neutral;Use rather than the raw PROPN API if you 're going to do this in C#.
2191;neutral;I never said I was angry by the way. Just noting what I saw as a design flaw.
2192;neutral;I did n't specify it clearly, rather than looking for a library, I am looking for a web- application/ component, that I can embed inside my java application so that I do n't even have to worry about creating the PROPN.
2193;neutral;I think the fact that you have SVN at the moment makes this question less obvious. A managers might avoid formalising something from fear that a poorly conceived process will trump being reactive. There are many options, and finding the right combination may require a series of smaller changes.
2194;negative;For what it 's worth, PROPN does this too( you can see it in action in the PROPN sample code). They apparently wait for a" quiet period" in which you 've stopped dragging. I 've been trying to write a similar class, and it is definitely a pain to get the animations to run consistently and properly during the resize.
2195;negative;Wo n't that be horribly distracting?
2196;positive;Awesome, thanks!
2197;negative;I 'm not sure what you mean by" pure C" but PROPN() and string.h have been part of PROPN PROPN for 20 years.
2198;positive;Great tutorial. Really appreciate it!
2199;positive;@Evan It 's not compilable java. It 's used to navigate the code in eclipse/ idea and is excellent if you have a large code base with lots of long class names.
2200;negative;Does it make sense to start learning JavaFx if I do not have any background in PROPN programming? Is it more advisable to learn Swing first and then move on to PROPN? I tried the on PROPN website in PROPN and the code looked extremely complicated to me. I am wondering if PROPN is too advanced for a beginnner PROPN developer.
2201;positive;There was an excellent presentation at PROPN this year on advanced scrollview techniques. You may want to spend an hour watching that. It might be of great help to you in this situation. The video is available in PROPN under the PROPN U section or from the apple developer site.
2202;neutral;PROPN Hosting one price, an entire cloud hosting server
2203;neutral;I want to use the mouse scrollwheel in my PROPN PROPN program to zoom in and out of a scene? How do I do that?
2204;negative;PROPN- PROPN snobbery! Every language uses a separate platform on some level to parse and execute the code. PROPN is just another language, capable of writing" programs" or" scripts".
2205;negative;@gnud: No, it 's not an implementation detail. It makes it a pain when you 've been given an integer in" natural" base( i.e. PROPN) and you need to use it with the calendar API.
2206;positive;PROPN is an excellent tool to to show a screen media CSS for some PROPN element, but is there a way to look at the print media CSS too? Or is there any other tool to see the print media PROPN?
2207;negative;Just a word of advice- this will be painful to extend if you later want to add a proper user- login system, and/or a threaded reply structure.
2208;positive;As mentioned above, some of the fundamental PROPN PROPN PROPN principles are PROPN, PROPN, PROPN and PROPN. An excellent overview of these by PROPN PROPN PROPN( of PROPN PROPN) is available here:
2209;positive;i really love the PROPN validation plugins, look neat stylish and accessible, but as you know PROPN can be turned off and boom your user can enter what ever he wants, therefore you should validate on server too, so what is the best approach here? do double validation one with jquery and one on server side or is there a better solid secure way?
2210;negative;This is a stupidity of windows find utility, +1 for feeling my pain.
2211;positive;Thanks, after using it for a couple of hours, I can say that 's a great soft, definitely!
2212;positive;+1 Very interesting question!
2213;positive;Awesome!! Thanks :)
2214;positive;I am in need of generating a random string with spaces and mixedCase. is all I got so far: I am getting only uppercase strings with no spaces- I believe the tweak should be pretty striaghtforward to get mixed case and spaces in the soup. Any help greatly appreciated!
2215;negative;I 'm only generating the PROPN. The PROPN and its PROPN() method are hand- coded in a different assembly from the PROPN altogether. So I 'm afraid this wo n't work.
2216;negative;I have a query that has PROPN 20 columns and I would like to export this to an PROPN file with the column headers. I thought this would be easy to figure out but no luck! I searched the web and found one suggestion that did not end up working so I am stuck. Anyone have any working ideas? Thanks,
2217;positive;Although that text editor test is n't 15 minutes, it sounds like an excellent test. It 's more like what you would do in real life compared to writing algorithms: maintain code that someone else might have made.
2218;positive;Excellent- I 've unaccepted the original answer. I shall try this tomorrow. Thanks both of you.
2219;negative;I am using PROPN PROPN. I have an external library that consists of a bunch of PROPN files, and some PROPN PROPN. I know that I can attach the PROPN PROPN to individual JARs by going to their Properties page, PROPN location, and setting it there. But it would be a pain to do this for each individual PROPN. Is it possible to do them all at once somehow? The PROPN location is the same for them all.
2220;positive;Great question, but please update the accepted answer to PROPN 's! :)
2221;negative;I am extracting some data from PROPN PROPN. One of the columns is a ntext column that has a blob of PROPN there. As I extract it, it looks really ugly. Is there any way to format the XML inside a PROPN PROPN 2005 stored proc?
2222;neutral;I 'm working with an incorrectly built spring application. Rather than use PROPN, objects that require references are pulling their references from the context: Putting aside the non- IOC design, what are the other detrimental effects of this? For example, does this have any particular performance implications? Is there any way that this could result in the creation of additional contexts or object references? Anything else really unpleasant that this could cause?
2223;neutral;It 's always a balance:- too much TDD and you end up with code that works, but is a pain to work on.- too much' maintable code, clean design, and sound architecture' and you end up with that have talked themselves into coding paralysis PROPN in all things.
2224;positive;I agree: Awesome answer! Thank you so much for this borad overview( even if it may be a little bit outdated by now).
2225;neutral;I am currently working on an n- tier system and battling some database performance issues. One area we have been investigating is the latency between the database server and the application server. In our test environment the average ping times between the two boxes is in the region of PROPN however on the clients site its more in the region of 8.2 ms. Is that somthing we should be worried about? For your average system what do you guys consider a resonable latency and how would you go about testing/ measuring the latency? PROPN
2226;negative;I have a PROPN app that uses PROPN to handle different types of PROPN, such as: I want to use memcached, but I keep getting the dreaded" unknown class/ module" error. I 've tried pre- loading all of my PROPN models to no avail. The first request works as normal, but the first pull from memcached errors out. I 've followed to no avail either. Is using memcached possible with single table inheritance?
2227;neutral;no. there is n't
2228;positive;Great question bud!
2229;negative;Can you be any more specific about the scenario you have in mind?" Optimization" is a terribly broad category.
2230;neutral;Is n't it just a base 64 encoded version of the serialized data?
2231;positive;Awesome, awesome answer. Thank you very much.
2232;negative;If you 're debugging at the instruction level rather than the source level, it 's an awful lot for you easier to map unoptimized instructions back to the source. Also, compilers are occasionally buggy in their optimizers. In the PROPN division at PROPN, all release binaries are built with debugging symbols and full optimizations. The symbols are stored in separate PDB files and do not affect the performance of the code. They do n't ship with the product, but most of them are available at the.
2233;neutral;What is a container?
2234;positive;The answer can be found in the. You should skim the excellent documentation that comes with PROPN
2235;neutral;Another way of PROPN command object is to call. That way you should n't have to set the PROPN property on the command object.
2236;neutral;I think that size_t PROPN( PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN, PROPN PROPN* PROPN); is what you want. Here is an example pulled from:
2237;positive;Your operating system does dozens of PROPN calls per second already. Do n't worry about it.
2238;positive;I now get it why it is sometimes facetiously referred to as the" PROPN PROPN: Do n't call us, we 'll call you"
2239;positive;If you want to try a new and alternative approach, this is a application core framework modelled after java OSGi: I have n't tried it myself, but it looks really cool!
2240;positive;Perhaps this is what you are looking for: Here is the link to download the PROPN PROPN PROPN: PROPN PROPN!
2241;neutral;Assume we want to validate user input, while user is typing in a JTextField. For validating the user input, I wonder if I could use PROPN. Assume the input should follow this example regex: How can I do this with ragel? Can anybody give a short example how to validate user input" on the fly"( while inputing) with ragel? The PROPN documentations misses some good examples for a PROPN PROPN, so I ask here.
2242;positive;awesome answer! very helpful
2243;positive;Awesome! I 'm actually familiar with PROPN. I 'm going to look into this.
2244;positive;I find by PROPN PROPN to be an excellent overview of a variety of PROPN architectures. Hope it helps :)
2245;positive;You might want to poke around in, and also the. Another place where you can specifically ask questions is the PROPN PROPN PROPN for PROPN- send an email to PROPN PROPN this helps! PROPN
2246;neutral;After reading a discussion on PROPN PROPN concerning. Is GLUT dead for graphics programming? Is PROPN all the rage now for PROPN programming?
2247;positive;+1 Fantastic question! I have no idea when I would ever use this, but I 'm fascinated to know someone needs this.
2248;negative;For instance, will I be able to create an application that allows users to create and modify existing types at runtime? Will I be able to persist instances of those types in PROPN without having to worry about the user who adds 100,000 records and expects a( really) fast query on them? Think PROPN PROPN PROPN ... but on steroids. PROPN steroids- Possible or not?
2249;neutral;You should definitely HTML encode before assigning posted content to the PROPN body of an email. Your code should already be rejecting content such as PROPN< script>' as invalid, not just in the case of an email but in all cases. There are no other considerations you need to worry about.
2250;neutral;` internal` exists so that API vendors( such as PROPN) can write classes without worrying about random strangers using their code. Whenever an API becomes public, the vendor can no longer easily change the signatures. When` internal`, if PROPN chooses to, they can change their code without fear of breaking other people 's code. That is, unless they are using reflection to" cheat".
2251;negative;that 's some very dangerous advice!
2252;positive;Awesome! Its resolve my issue. But is there any way to copy/ move files with billion of numbers and without removing existing files/ folders?
2253;positive;I 've got an application that I 'm moving over to PROPN and the app has a moderately sized data folder with hundreds of files that I need to inlcude in the deployment. The folder needs to be in the same place relative to the PROPN after deployment. I 've seen several suggestions on how to do this but there does n't seem to be a agreed upon method for doing this. Any suggestions would be great- Thanks!
2254;neutral;try f- in- box flajector.
2255;neutral;That would be unlikely. It depends on the randomness of the generated account number and the number of active accounts. With managed code you have to recurse 10s of thousands of times in order to break the stack. When the probability of non- uniqueness approaches 10,000:1, then it 's time to worry.
2256;neutral;What do you mean by" implement it"? How to avoid violating the rule?
2257;positive;I 've used the PROPN library in the past, it 's easy to use and fast in evaluation.
2258;negative;rmeader: if you have clients who can barely restart their computer it is a pain. And from what I heard some versions of windows do n't automatically synch time ...
2259;positive;it was very helpful :)
2260;neutral;The PROPN licensed might be the right solution. It 's a complete managed port of PROPN, so it can be used with PROPN.
2261;positive;that is what I am doing now. I find this a more practical solution and I see there are other people doing the same. Well, great!
2262;negative;Shortcut keys often do n't work the same way across all browsers. And they are awful on PROPN. And most users wo n't use them. The only thing I 'd bother with on most sites is buttons for next and prev, and I 'd also make the alt tag say" next" or" previous" to assist browsers with fast forward.
2263;positive;I ca n't get any event triggers to work. A simplified example of what I 'm doing is below- I know there is a event on PROPN since it is defined in but I 'm still getting Can not convert string' PROPN' in attribute' PROPN' to object of type' System. Windows. PROPN' as soon as i run the application. Any help would be hugely appreciated.
2264;positive;The PROPN profiler is an excellent commercial solution. You can find further information in the docs on and.
2265;negative;+1 for the /f I 've written couple of scripts for that but without /f it was such a pain; required me to be there when running the script to type" y+[return]"
2266;neutral;You might be able to use an anti- CSRF token to achieve what you 're after. This article explains it in more detail:
2267;negative;If you just want to test the build, you can suppress the lines concerning ChartFx from the .licx file created by PROPN PROPN. It should build this way, but probably will not execute correctly, as the license will not be included. The .licx file contains instructions to include binary license resource during build. I 'm afraid that if you want a real build you have to install ChartFx on the build server.
2268;neutral;PROPN does n't belong in a library. I think you nailed it with" emerging anti- pattern". It 's really pretty easy to locate configuration files relative to a library; they do n't need to physically go in the same PROPN to be found.
2269;neutral;If there is no maximum a brute force attack can count on collisions too, i.e. the malicious user will be able to enter 1000 characters for example that produce the same hash as the original password with 8 symbols.
2270;neutral;Undefined behavior if the character is not found. Also you should not use` strstr`( with or without the typo) if` strchr` would suffice.
2271;positive;that 's the hope :)
2272;positive;PROPN/ PROPN PROPN from PROPN PROPN. I happily paid the$ 200 or so price for this. Excellent PROPN(+ good PROPN,+ debugging capability) with easy creation and editing of PROPN/ PROPN packages, SPs, PROPN etc So much better than PROPN.
2273;positive;Hi I have designed a query that returns a set of data such as: What I want to do in PROPN PROPN PROPN is to display data in a grid fashion. Such as For the dataset I provide. I want it to auto page break when needed, etc. Is there anything built in that I can use? Any recommendations on how to do this is greatly appreicated! Thanks.
2274;negative;Linked lists have operations which a FIFO queue does not( enumerate the list, remove items from the middle, etc). So personally, I 'd fear that if a list is used as a queue without encapsulation, then in future some fool( probably me) will fail to observe the FIFO constraint.
2275;neutral;I am using the PROPN method from PROPN to hide a window( cmd.exe) from the user( mainly to prevent them from closing it). When the user opens the form, the process is started, and hid, then when the form is closing the process is killed. However, when the form is opened again, it does n't hide the window( and sometimes does n't the first time) Can someone help me with this?
2276;positive;Then perhaps Might be of some help. If need be you could always do the registry editing yourself via API directly for the association ... but up to you EDIT: Also read the comments there, some good points eg the use of quotes for paths with spaces: @"C:\SomePath\MyApp.exe""% 1""" Also permission issues for registry access esp with PROPN ... good luck :)
2277;negative;I am writing an application which uses the PROPN. PROPN. PROPN. PROPN assembly to export/ import data from PROPN spreadsheets. Everything was going fine( except for 1 based indexing and all those optional parameters!), until I tried to use conditional formatting. When I call PROPN. PROPN. Add I get a MissingMethodException telling me that no such method exists. This happens in both PROPN and PROPN. Here 's an example of the code that generates the exception:
2278;neutral;Effectively what needs to happen is that changes I have marked as live or stable needs to be merged with the Live website. This effectively means I do n't have to worry about accidently copying over files and if something goes wrong it could be reverted to the previous version again. I 'll investigate post_commit hook but I 'll have to find a way to do a backup first so that a problem with PROPN kill the site.
2279;positive;That is really, really, really smart! Thanks.
2280;neutral;Is it possible to compile and run PROPN programs from under PROPN? If yes, how?
2281;positive;not for my company, so I do n't have to worry ;-)
2282;neutral;How do you use network sockets in PROPN?
2283;positive;There is a book called which details pen and paper drawing and what you can gain from it. I think it has a lot of benefits, particularly that you can, very early on( and easily), modify what the end result will be without much effort, and then start off on the right foot.
2284;positive;By creating datastore models that inherit from the PROPN class I can make my model- entities/ instances have dynamic properties. That is great! But what I want is the names of these dynamic properties to be determined at runtime. Is that possible? For example, Is this possible? If yes, how to do this? I have already tried some funny ways to do this but did not succeed :P Thanks in advance.
2285;positive;Wow! 3 lines of code instead of a page ... I wish I could vote PROPN.
2286;positive;Came here to improve my home- grown image resizer and discovered The PROPN PROPN. It 's EXCELLENT. +1 for PROPN PROPN!
2287;negative;i hate being that guy, but this is really not the way to do whatever you aretrying to do
2288;neutral;Speed of data entry. We have data entry operators who hammer data in using the keyboard( and often just the numeric keypad) so it 's impractical for them to reach for the mouse half way through an entry screen.
2289;positive;The paper is an excellent discussion on branching patterns such as the" main line" pattern you mention- it lists the options in the form of patterns together with discussion of anti- patterns. One of the authors is PROPN PROPN of PROPN.
2290;negative;I 've tried several other PROPN( the last one was eclipse) but always come crying back. The thing I end up missing most is PROPN 's' tag insight' for all the html tags.
2291;neutral;It comes down to' designing for testability'. Ideally, you should not instantiate those PROPN objects directly but should access them through a layer of indirection that can be replaced by a mock object. Now, PROPN itself does provide a level of indirection and you could provide a mock object that provided a substitute for the real one but I suspect it would be a pain to create and I doubt if you 'd get much help from an existing mocking framework.
2292;neutral;PROPN is correct. It 's a folder structure with quite a few xml documents inside. A plain text option might not be desirable( multiple files to manage ...)
2293;negative;PROPN is now dead :(
2294;negative;I completely disagree with the answers so far. I feel that internal is a horrid idea, preventing another assembly from inheriting your types, or even using your internal types should the need for a workaround come about. Today, I had to use reflection in order to get to the internals of a System. Data. PROPN( I have to build a datatable lightning fast, without all of its checks), and I had to use reflection, since not a single type was available to me; they were all marked as internal.
2295;positive;+1 excellent question. Personally I 'm starting to think that externals should never have been allowed to track the HEAD of other repositories. Always specifying the exact revision of the external is much safer.
2296;positive;I am not familiar with the instance manager, but I have used on several systems( including a remotely hosted server) with great success. It supports MySQL 5.0 and 4.1.
2297;negative;I had to do this once in Notes for a plugin I was developing. What I ended up doing was editing the PROPN template in the designer, and then writing some PROPN behind it that called a .NET class via a PROPN. So when you clicked the button, it triggered the event in the PROPN, and then called the PROPN, and passed the item information to it. I should also note that it was a freakin' bear to figure out because PROPN documentation is terrible.
2298;neutral;PROPN. PROPN
2299;neutral;PROPN, the PROPN baud was effectively limited only by the PROPN/ PROPN- I wrote my config to allow up to 1.3Mb, but I was targeting modems over PROPN so 115 PROPN was the PROPN that I needed, and likely the PROPN that I ever will.
2300;neutral;My understanding is that PROPN is deprecated and OBJECT is the preferred tag to use for Java applets. Is this correct? A lot of PROPN applet examples, both on the web and in books, still seem to use the APPLET tag. Are there any browser compatibility issues that OBJECT suffers from( compared to PROPN)? Also, can you provide an example of proper OBJECT tag usage for PROPN applets?
2301;positive;Good enough answer for me :) I get the same, lets hope they fix it soon because XBAP deployment I 'm learning to love!
2302;positive;PROPN, PROPN is written in PROPN .NET and is a very successful example of a high- scale site.
2303;neutral;PROPN PROPN: That implementation of PROPN is a mixed- mode assembly which is not supported by PROPN. Only a pure managed implementation would work under the PROPN PROPN.
2304;negative;Would one be violating the the terms of agreement with PROPN PROPN PROPN if one were to use PROPN 's PROPN service with PROPN PROPN PROPN? I do know there is restrictions on what you can and ca n't do but I was not sure of this. Having these two combined features, one could provide one heck of a system at a relatively low cost compared to hosting this with a hosting company. Has anyone done this already or have heard of an application that combines the two technologies?
2305;neutral;You should try PROPN PROPN. Right Click the class and PROPN PROPN PROPN. There are so many option look for PROPN all inherited members. It can be found at the PROPN section of the PROPN PROPN PROPN.
2306;positive;I can not recommend higher than you reading through the postings of PROPN PROPN PROPN(), he is really brilliant when it comes to PROPN. His recent series covered dynamic PROPN, starting with Absolutely beautiful code.
2307;neutral;Add a bit of demonstration code and I 'll upvote.
2308;neutral;For a non- installation browser based tool you can try It 's free- and if you have a gmail account- no registration is needed. Makes interactive/ Step by PROPN Or PROPN PROPN prototypes. You can share your protoype with anyone you choose by just sending a link. Works for us ...
2309;positive;I am currently using the following PROPN script to highlight rows in my table, and it works great! This works great for tables of data where each row is truly a new record, however, I have run into an issue where I have records that take up two rows of data and would like to modify the PROPN so it renders something like: How would I accomplish this in PROPN where I want every 3rd row to have a class of' alt1' and every 4th row to have a class of' PROPN'? Thanks in advance!
2310;positive;Wow- why would someone vote to close? This is a great debate!!
2311;neutral;When opening a file from your hard drive into your browser, where is the document root? To illustrate, given the following PROPN code, if the page is opened from the local machine(file:///) then where should the css file be for the browser to find it?
2312;negative;You can analyse changes using the PROPN API down to the level of what files have changed, but to determine what content in a file has changed you need to use external tool/ library. There is a comparison/ merge tool that ships with PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN but this is still an external tool that processes the changes at runtime. Just PROPN. Edit: I think I may be completely wrong!
2313;neutral;I 'm in everyone else 's boat, this would prove incredibly useful, especially in my case where I know I need to closely examine the last 4 revisions. Analogous experience with limiting the number of log messages displayed would make it very natural to limit the number of revisions one retrieves going back from the current version.
2314;neutral;the link to the last article( PROPN for PROPN PROPN) expired. Here is the link to the new article:
2315;positive;Funny, that is exactly what I just did. Great question!
2316;neutral;How can I check file permissions, without having to run operating system specific command via PROPN() or PROPN()?
2317;neutral;yeah, i had the same issue
2318;negative;I am currently a college student and I do n't feel that any of my classes have touched on the PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN( PROPN) nearly enough. I 've been interning a company for a few years and I 've been learning about PROPN from the internship, but I wanted to poll the crowd so I can branch out from that. What PROPN resources( books, websites, magazines, newsletters, etc.) do you use?
2319;positive;is a popular choice. It 's a full multimedia framework much like PROPN or PROPN, has the advantage of having legally licensed codecs available, and has excellent PROPN bindings.
2320;neutral;I have n't noticed the sort of fear that you have. Do you have any specific examples?
2321;neutral;I generally use a manual process: Look at the page, figure out the semantic elements, and build the PROPN PROPN up the images I think I 'll need PROPN writing CSS PROPN and repeat different steps as necessary Got a better approach, or a tool?
2322;positive;If you package this code in a class library like I did, you 'll have to change the access modifier from` internal` to` public`. Excellent code, saved me a lot of time.
2323;negative;Unless there is a very valid reason, passwords should hashed. Hashes result in fixed length strings. There is not space argument to make, unless the system is storing the actual password, which is arguably a terrible idea.
2324;positive;Awesome! Thanks.
2325;neutral;Is this a question that would be better suited to[ programmers.stackexchange](
2326;negative;Everything in the terminal buffer. Command history is easy, just' history'. Sometimes there 's an exception or a log I want to grab, but it went off the screen or select- all is a pain. I want to make a cmd line tool that does it and maybe sends it to a new gist.
2327;positive;Very nice plugin!! I really admire people that put more time into making PROPN more usable. I 've added your plugin to my list here:
2328;positive;How would I go about using PROPN PROPN' fantastic PROPN singleton?() I would like to start with something incredibly simple .. like display the input volume in a textview or just display a UIImage when the listener detects something. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
2329;negative;Poor PROPN just got screwed over by people not reading what he wrote correctly. I hate it when that happens, but I can understand why they read it the way they did. You left the statement rather ambiguous.
2330;negative;Sad that you had to preface with" Reasons for doing this aside" in order to prevent a flame war or such ...
2331;neutral;The example you gave is not of PROPN, it is PROPN PROPN example.
2332;positive;I did try the demo and did end up buying it. I 'm thrilled( thus far). Thanks for your comment.
2333;neutral;If you are looking to find out which PROPN 's your target machine is missing then use depends.exe which used to come with PROPN, but can also be found. Testing this on a few target machines should tell you which PROPN 's you need to package with your application.
2334;negative;I do n't use PROPN, but what I 've read so far about it does not certify the" incredibly bad python implementation"[ PROPN fixed].
2335;positive;I 'm trying to make our mySQL database run faster and I 've analyzed our slow query log and the most common slow query is this: I 'm trying to understand why this query keeps getting called because after the table is setup it should not keep happening. The PROPN result for this is: Can not convert to a PROPN statement. Any ideas on this would be fantastic! PROPN
2336;neutral;Check the answer on question[ Mobile PROPN back button](
2337;positive;Very good question!
2338;positive;I build Web service, I define PROPN connection( all works excellent) but, how I can define the PROPN in variable? now, I change with the Find and replace in VS2008 and right click on the Web service properties. PROPN 's in advance
2339;positive;PROPN PROPN PROPN has an excellent post on using cache item callbacks for this purpose.
2340;neutral;for debugging purpose in a somewhat closed system, I have to output text in a file. Does anyone knows of a tool that runs on windows( console based or not) that detects changes to a file and outputs them in real- time?
2341;neutral;Have you considered overriding the administrative templates for the models in question? This provides an excellent overview of the process. In this particular situation, having a finer- grained level of control may be the best way to achieve the desired result.
2342;negative;( For the record, I find the PROPN PROPN controls to be considerably easier than their PROPN controls. I think a lot of their bad rep comes from the PROPN side of the world, where certain tasks become a major pain and their PROPN usage is off the charts.)
2343;neutral;A container is a concept in IoC where the object model, including dependencies( relationships between" user" object and" used" object) and object instances, reside and is managed -- e.g., contained. The container is usually provided by a PROPN framework, such as PROPN. Think of it as a runtime repository for the objects that make up your application.
2344;positive;To PROPN PROPN 's excellent list, I add the PROPN command- line script which comes with PROPN library XML::XPath. A great way to extract information from PROPN files:
2345;negative;Ah- and if PROPN is so expensive that adding that salt will in fact cost the hacker years then it is also going to be so expensive that you 'll probably be suffering to add to CC number 10,000. But you can always just test it vs your expected customer base size and see if it hurts of not.
2346;positive;+1: I just used implemented this, it works great!
2347;positive;Awesome!!! You just saved me a PROPN of work!!! Wish I could give more than just an upvote!!!
2348;negative;-1 for font abuse
2349;positive;+1 I have n't such items in the right- click menu, but PROPN PROPN way works great, thanks!
2350;negative;I hate it none of the specified answers worked for me ....
2351;negative;I 'm not sure I follow what you mean by" service layer" ..." service" is such an abused generic term these days :-(
2352;negative;PROPN, the power tools SHOULD let you do this, but unfortunately the merge goes horribly wrong each time so it 's next to useless.
2353;negative;I do n't know any opensource solutions, and the guys writing this stuff for money ca n't and wo n't tell you. Guess you 're out of luck :]
2354;neutral;Only way I could figure out how to do it without just moving the file and telling the user was to pass it off to the browser.
2355;negative;First of all I ca n't see object locking, unused lockObject variable makes me sad. PROPN is not special. Each thread will have it 's own copy of reference to some instance of sektioner object. You ca n't affect other threads that way. What would happen with old version of data pointed by sektioner field largely depends on calling party.
2356;negative;PROPN@ fault? PROPN ... hate when my buddy fails me.
2357;negative;I m not sure what they 're called but i m referring to the keywords in c++. Is there an equivalent in c#? It seems rather tedious having to repeat yourself! PROPN
2358;neutral;If you decide to use events to drive your swf in order to approximate different frame rates I 'd recommend using a tween engine like. It 's free( as in beer) and I 've used it very successfully for frame based tweening in the past.
2359;positive;That would be really great if you share link to the example.
2360;positive;I 'd say PROPN should be part of the iteration plan. not just in time. They should be accounted for the story they belong to. Even reading of parts of the manual should be estimated. And now for the hard part: do n't be afraid to give high estimates. PROPN is ALWAYS better than too low. ;)
2361;negative;I need to write some code that will buffer a line to create a polygon as shown below. From following the steps outlined, I can create polygon shapes around simple lines that do not cross themselves or have too tight curves, but as the lines I 'm trying to buffer are squiggly swhirly hurricane tracks, it 's really not good enough. I know there 's a function in PROPN PROPN 2008 that can do this, but I 'm afraid that 's currently a no go. Can anyone point me in the direction of a more complete PROPN I can follow, or any background info that could help me figure this out?
2362;neutral;PROPN is extremely cheap when you have the distro( or staff to build) that carries PROPN PROPN edition. This is a High PROPN version which offers multi- master replication over many servers. Pros are low( license-) costs after initial purchase of hardware( Gigs of PROPN needed!) and time to set up. The drawbacks are suboptimal performance with many joins, no full- text indexing, stored procesures( I think) and one need to replicate grants to every master node. Yet it 's easier to run than the replication/ proxy balancing setup that 's available for PostgreSQL.
2363;neutral;Are all URL 's encrypted when using PROPN) encryption? I would like to know because I want all URL data to be hidden when using PROPN). If PROPN gives you total URL encryption then I do n't have to worry about hiding confidential information form URLs.
2364;negative;How is a question about hosting less programming related than this which gets plenty of up votes
2365;neutral;I 'm convinced that this is a combination of PROPN and PROPN issues. If I understand correctly, PROPN is using outdated PROPN API calls for printers, which leads to these issues. The problem is in PROPN its self, but the only reason PROPN suffers this problem is because it 's using outdated PROPN API calls. If the PROPN were upgraded to use the newer methods, this problem presumably would n't happen. At least this is my hunch.
2366;negative;Most DNS servers do n't obey RFC1912 to be honest. Its a sad thing about ISPs.
2367;positive;___ Yours was very good AND FAST!! thanks for the response___
2368;negative;If you are concerned about code re- ordering you are either creating some funky and hard to understand and maintain code, or else you probably do n't need to worry about it. Can you explain why you think the code snippet you supplied will be reordered?
2369;positive;I really love the" one model in- one model out" idea of PROPN PROPN. A controller would look something like this and the service locator would automagically fill in all the required dependencies in the constructor. This makes the controller very easy to test. So my question is: How would you go about tweaking PROPN PROPN to allow this simplicity in the controllers?
2370;positive;I love it when I find the answer to my question without having to ask- thanks for running into the same question I had and helping me work through my issues!
2371;positive;We have eclipse manage things the way it wants, and use PROPN( a set of ant tasks) for continuous builds. Works great!
2372;neutral;Get at that with PROPN and you 'll notice something about the classes of the generated dialog- ui- widget and/or ui- state are completely absent, but those are the classes that PROPN uses to color PROPN elements! Is there some sort of ThemeRoller- compliant dialog generator, or even a script to hack the right display classes into a dialog after the fact? Or, since I 'm not intending to let my users edit their own themes, do I just have to do the bit of CSS hackery that the PROPN people apparently did, putting color information into PROPN?
2373;positive;PROPN PROPN says: PROPN 12th, 2009 at 6:50 am No, we     ve switched to a dedicated task. We definitely outgrew this technique. I do think it     s fine for small sites though!
2374;positive;Found this on PROPN a while ago: Hope it helps!
2375;neutral;I do not want to stop the user from clicking the same ajax button many times, but I want to exercise some control to prevent someone from maliciously clicking the button repeatedly which would cause repeated database requests. What is simple way to handle this on a jquery .post in PROPN PROPN? If I put in a time delay, the experience client side will be ruined(?)
2376;positive;Somewhere on the web there is a blog post which is just a lot of scrum boards. It is really good to see how other people do it. Maybe someone can find it for us :) I think this looks like a pretty comprehensive way of doing things!
2377;neutral;Aye this is the precise issue I suffer with PROPN+ PROPN. I just want it to boot quicker.
2378;positive;I have a product selection page where you choose a phone and a plan using radio buttons and I need PROPN to display the" current selection". For example I have 2 phones with two plans: PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN,$ 35/ month and$ 50/ month Each of these' options' has it 's own radio button. When PROPN and the$ 50/ month plan are selected I need to display this information in a div: Your Current PROPN Phone: PROPN PROPN PROPN:$ 50/ month Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)
2379;negative;I hate to say it, but constant polling over PROPN is the poor mans solution.
2380;negative;I do n't want to do anything fancy on PROPN except post to it via my site once a day. I have searched around a bit and there are all sorts of super- complex ways to do every little thing that PROPN does, but there seems to be little documentation on how to do the simplest thing, which is make a post! Does anyone know how to do this? Or can you at least point me in the right direction? I do n't need full wrappers or anything(), just one simple function that will post to PROPN. Thanks!
2381;neutral;This only works for 4 or 8 byte floats. What about 10- byte floats?
2382;negative;I 'm apologize for saying this, but the code you 've posted is simply awful and needs desperate refactoring. Create a class to represent 7 properties instead of 7 parallel arraylists, and use String.split to parse a comma- seperated list.
2383;positive;Excellent, well thought out and worded question. +1, more if it were only possible!
2384;positive;Great question! :)
2385;positive;Wow! That was an astoundingly fast and informative response by all! I am very impressed. I will add a couple more comments below. Thanks all!
2386;positive;Pretty outstanding book: Gives you a good overview of the architecture of PROPN, as well as the query language PROPN, and administrative/ maintenance overview. A good primer for a developer OR a system administrator.
2387;negative;I host a project on PROPN, but a bunch( 200+) files need to have their extension changed. What is the easiest, least painful way to do this? I ca nt see myself doing them one by one in the PROPN. Update: I know I can just remove and change them via the commandline/ utility, and readd them, but that would lose history. Perhaps there is some commandline interface to PROPN on PROPN?
2388;neutral;A blog post warning you about the inefficiencies of PROPN PROPN:
2389;negative;unfortunatly most browsers think PROPN() is malicious and do n't allow it to close itself without at least prompting the user :(
2390;neutral;Hire a force of intimidating fellows to stand behind your users while holding baseball bats. That should prevent them from doing anything undesirable with your application.
2391;positive;Great answer! If I may update it to Rails 3, the json method now seems to be to_json. At least that 's what worked for me ... i.e. @contact.to_json
2392;negative;I am about to alter the several tables in a massive system which I probably only understand around 10%. I want to add three columns. One of these is just a rename of an existing column. Part of me wants to:- Rename the column but worried about the impact on unknown parts of the system that use the old name. Append the three columns to the table therefore making the old column redundant( over time).
2393;neutral;I could be missing something( I 'm nothing of an expert) but after following your steps I still have to package all* dll PROPN 's in the* exe* folder. Was n't it OP 's intention to have everything packaged into the* exe* file?
2394;neutral;I did a quick PROPN search and did n't see anything super- great to automate creation and updating of my google sitemap for the PROPN on rails app. Any suggestions?
2395;neutral;You can use the PROPN PROPN. There is a PROPN component with checkboxes[
2396;negative;Can somebody point me to a resource that explains how to go about having 2+ PROPN web server clustered( or PROPN not sure what its called)? All I need is something basic, an overview how and where to start. Ca n't seem to find anything ...
2397;negative;PROPN is an external executable, while erb is a library within PROPN. You would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files( e.g. quick- and- dirty PROPN replacement), and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other PROPN script. It is more common to use ERB simply because it is more flexible, but I 'll admit that I have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute files for quick little utility websites.
2398;neutral;Regarding selling agile, one angle of approach is proposing agile techniques as a way of reducing the" project crunch". By this I mean the overwhelming list of deferred issues," 99% complete" code and oversights that accumulate towards the end of the project. This normally causes a lot of stress and compromises in order to meet the deadline. If a development organisation has never experienced project crunch, it would be a big surprise to me. Therefore I think this is a neat way of locking into a some shared pain and suggesting agile techniques as a load- levelling technique should provoke some interest that can lead onto a more complete discussion of the methodology(s).
2399;positive;I have 2 images inside a folder called PROPN ..... PROPN and PROPN. What code must i place inside my Submit button to just delete Image1.jpg located here" PROPN/ PROPN" Any help would be great!!!
2400;neutral;My application has a frame that is loaded/ navigated when certain top- level buttons are clicked. The problem is, one of the hosted pages has a frame of it 's own, and is messing with the outer frame 's navigation bar( clicking back and forward navigates the inner frame, as well as the outer frame). Is there any way to have the outer frame 's navigation control only worry about its immediate contents?
2401;neutral;Is there a implementation in glibc or any of the standard PROPN libraries for C? I want to be able to add to a list without worrying about its size. I know std::vector exists for PROPN, but I need the C equivalent.
2402;negative;i PROPN   ll try this. string needs to be iterable. and while we are at it: how come java is so damn awful? no sane person would specify` remove` in an interface, just to add` throws UnsupportedOperationException- if the remove operation is not supported by this Iterator`.
2403;neutral;I personally mark most methods and properties virtual. I use proxies and lazy loading alot, so I do n't want to have to worry about changing things at a later date.
2404;neutral;Add this to the main solution to make sure the the binding is updated to zero when the textbox is cleared.
2405;positive;Excellent question.
2406;neutral;Calling a virtual function is slightly slower than calling a nonvirtual function. However, I do n't think it matters how deep your inheritance tree is. But this is not a difference that you should normally be worried about.
2407;neutral;The following page has several implementations of general purpose hash functions that are efficient and exhibit minimal collisions:
2408;positive;has an excellent in depth article on setting up an PROPN web server on a PROPN box. Check out the article at the following link:
2409;negative;My guess would be from a colleague who wanted to scare this person out of ever using' this' again. It can be fairly annoying when someone uses' this' for every single thing they do. Not that it justifies lying to a new programmer, but I can imagine someone doing this out of frustration.
2410;neutral;Choose PROPN-> PROPN PROPN PROPN-> PROPN In the box for how you should link PROPN, choose to statically link it. Choose PROPN-> Input. Under PROPN PROPN, add any libraries you need your app to statically link in. For more info, see this article:
2411;positive;Not to take anything away from the answer already accepted, but I was able to get the duration of an audio file( several different formats, including PROPN, which is what I needed at the time) using the namespace. This is part of. Adding a reference to that made my code as simple as this ... And it 's pretty fast, too! Here 's a reference for the class.
2412;positive;old question, but if anyone finds this through PROPN( as I did) and who does not want to use anchors or jquery; there 's a builtin javascriptfunction to' jump' to an element; and what 's even better; according to the great compatibility- tables on quirksmode, this is!
2413;negative;I do n't know why but I used the tags in my post. It is showing fine in preview, but not in final post?!
2414;positive;Do n't forget this excellent devnet article meant for transitioning from PROPN to PROPN:
2415;neutral;Fear not, the highlighting returns with the next search. The command should probably be named clearhighlight.
2416;neutral;returns a pointer to the found character, so you could use pointer arithmetic:( Note: this code not tested for its ability to compile, it 's one step away from PROPN.)
2417;neutral;I think what he means is, you ca n't just read: PROPN. PROPN() and go to the definition of PROPN, because with IoC, PROPN is just an interface, and the actual implementation is unknown to you, unless you go look it up in PROPN PROPN files or the main method where your ioc gets setup.
2418;positive;@George- Very helpful, thanks!
2419;neutral;I 've been using PROPN extensions on PROPN the. Is PROPN the easier way to go? How do I get started with it?
2420;negative;@Andy: Give him the PROPN PROPN Of PROPN award!
2421;neutral;Basically I have some code to check a specific directory to see if an image is there and if so I want to assign a URL to the image to an PROPN.
2422;positive;How do I pull a single column of data out of a filled dataset? I have a filled dataset object, with a variety of tables. I need to get all of the data that is stored in a particular column in one of the tables, and bind a PROPN PROPN to it.( This may require me to pull the data out and make it into a string collection ...) If anyone has any bright ideas, it would be very grateful!
2423;neutral;try not to reference another post because they get out of order due to voting.
2424;neutral;How to print multiply flowdocumets in a batch? Following code should print different documents but print the same. This sample works pretty fine only if you print to the PROPN PROPN.
2425;positive;Hey guys. I told my wife all options that you gave and she went for" As PROPN", says it sounded more formal to her, and although PROPN matches the scenario too, she did n't like how it looked on the agreement. Could n't mark your answer as preferred since you put it as a comment ceejayoz. But, really thank you all for the very quick answers and taking the time to help!
2426;neutral;I 'm working with PROPN 6.1 and just hit this issue. There 's no emptySessionPath option in my server.xml. So, how can this be done for version 6.1?
2427;neutral;For the record, .Net PROPN 3.5 PROPN is required for PROPN PROPN PROPN 2008 to install and RTM'd around the same time as the release this week. Still a hefty install but you can extract the client profile from it. Just not to sure how.
2428;negative;Indeed, this is awful. A pity there is no option to change it. Every other PROPN/ editor I used opened tabs to the right.
2429;neutral;If you 're doing a git merge of a bunch of files and this is all you have to worry about, you have nothing to worry about.
2430;negative;How does one make PROPN( the default behavior for typing an opening"(" character? I want PROPN to automatically insert the closing")" after the cursor when I type a"(" character regardless of whether it 's part of an PROPN- key combination. PROPN, I want to extend this behavior to quotes, subquotes, brackets and braces. Typing PROPN( is a pain, and there do n't appear to be any comparable forms for those other characters.
2431;neutral;path/ to/ build/ dir/ libtool --mode= execute gdb path/ to/ executable. I think libtool is an effective and terrible solution.
2432;neutral;It does n't appear to be possible.
2433;neutral;No, I 'm afraid not
2434;neutral;This could be terribly trivial, but I 'm having trouble finding an answer that executes in less than PROPN time. Let 's say I have two string arrays and I want to know which strings exist in both arrays. How would I do that, efficiently, in PROPN or is there a way to do this other than a double loop?
2435;negative;I abhor debugging a` forEach` loop. Step in, step out. It 's so much easier to just debug a` for` loop;
2436;neutral;The operative word in your question being" I". When_ I_ step through ... it works. When_ I_ double click ... it works. When_ Windows_ runs ... it does n't work.
2437;neutral;PROPN is down again.
2438;negative;I for checking whether the function exists yet. In summary: Does that work for you? If it does then you can just wrap in a loop. A bit less nasty than a PROPN!
2439;neutral;i thought the question said' specifically in PROPN PROPN 2005'?
2440;neutral;I want to copy a file from A to PROPN in C#. How do I do that?
2441;negative;I 've seen this bug in resharper 4.1. It happens when the base class is in the PROPN directory. Do n't know how to fix it, very annoying, code still compiles though.
2442;neutral;It appears that PROPN is aware of this issue and they have ... I do n't know if this was addressed in PROPN B2 ... you might try it and see. Good luck!
2443;positive;great question!
2444;positive;Hehe this is nothing compared to some other little adventures I had with them ^_^" ... I love them* ^o^*!!
2445;negative;PROPN, indecent exposure of mod_rewrite should be a crime. Put a bathrobe on it, or something.
2446;neutral;PROPN is both correct and incorrect, at least wrt to PROPN and PROPN. An applet can get access to the PROPN session by cheating. In my case, we added the session i d as a parameter to the applet, which the applet then adds as a cookie in it 's requests. Seems to work ok.( We encrypted the session PROPN d to foil those nasty hacker folk!)
2447;neutral;Maybe, but that 's not what he asked. He was worried instead about losing a pointer to that particular location in memory, which is a dubious concept in PROPN anyhow.
2448;neutral;I was using ruby and PROPN to design the user interface for a while in the new version of glade3 i can use gtkbuilder format to generated xml file instead of libglade. is there any example? i searched PROPN but i had no luck!
2449;positive;Great! I see that I am limited to 5 searches per hour. Are there any other limitations, for example can I use this every day?
2450;positive;Wow, thanks for the answers! This helps a lot.
2451;negative;Malice? Seriously though, it 's hard to account for formatting style sometimes. It 's largely a matter of personal taste. Personally, I think that both forms are a little nasty unless you 're seriously restricted in terms of line- length.
2452;positive;I do n't know the answer to this question, but the book" Understanding the PROPN PROPN" has a lot of good information on this type of stuff. It 's a really great book, anyone doing kernel work should read it.
2453;positive;Very useful, Thanks You!
2454;neutral;
2455;neutral;@Brian: You will probably agree that a) it is not a real question as far as grammar is concerned, and b) that this sentence is a totally buried in the text. You simply might get better answers if you make this a real question. Especially the first paragraph seems completely superfluous.
2456;positive;If you are going to do minimal PROPN stuff then the free and excellent tool PROPN will help you. Take a deep look here
2457;negative;Yes, I 'm afraid so. Do you happen to have a" PROPN world" PROPN PROPN that captures a cookie, and an example request that triggers it?
2458;neutral;I 'm asserting that cloning a VM does n't constituent" easy to do" regardless of your skill set as running the app then ends up being a pain. Others thresholds for" easy" may differ but I do n't think( without evidence) enough will to matter.
2459;neutral;templates are not inheritance
2460;neutral;Can anyone recommend some good resources that highlight the differences between PROPN and the AS/400 database? I am trying to help someone with a lot of AS/400 experience implement an PROPN installation, and they need some guidance. A book or online resource would be ideal.
2461;negative;PROPN has horrible formatting for PROPN :(
2462;positive;Amazingly extensive answer, thank you! I learned something today!
2463;positive;that is simply awesome :-)
2464;positive;Background: The PROPN is hosted on PROPN 2003. The queue that will receive the messages is a public queue. I have installed PROPN PROPN PROPN on the server. From some of the white papers on PROPN, it appears that you can insert messages into PROPN using PROPN/ PROPN. The process, however, of just finding the PROPN endpoint is not clear to me. Any help you could offer would be greatly appreciated! Wish you the best!
2465;negative;Can anyone think of a quick, easy and fullproof way of listing only PROPN PROPN PROPN views from PROPN? PROPN lsview obviously lists all the views, and you could search by looking at the PROPN: section if you run a ct lsview -properties -full( gives you Properties: snapshot webview readwrite) then use a regex or something, but I 'd be worried that someone calls their view' webview' or something. Has anyone got a foolproof way? Am I missing a flag or something? If only there was -fmt on lsview: S
2466;neutral;I do n't think there is an official naming convention, but i 've seen that PROPN use PROPN PROPN in the PROPN. PROPN PROPN( via reflector).
2467;neutral;` PROPN PROPN. PROPN PROPN> PROPN. PROPN) PROPN PROPN PROPN='.' || cc PROPN='-')`?
2468;negative;We have a 3- tier web application written in ASP.Net Webforms where we will not be able to port it- recession really sucks!- to PROPN. Our goal is to implement a plugin architecture. One way would be to use the PROPN folder. Are there any better alternatives?
2469;positive;I love PROPN PROPN 's blog! I would have considered putting this in the suggestion box if it was n't closed.
2470;positive;Great question!
2471;neutral;The question is not when, but what is the easiest and least painful method.
2472;negative;It was a painful process for us. I ca n't remember hardly any of the specific things that made it so difficult, but I do remember it sucked.
2473;positive;Thanks a lot, that 's great!
2474;neutral;Using Rails, is there a reason why I should store attachments( could be a file of any time), in the filesystem instead of in the database? The database seems simpler to me, no need to worry about filesystem paths, structure, etc., you just look in your blob field. But most people seem to use the filesystem that it leaves me guessing that there must be some benefits to doing so that I 'm not getting, or some disadvantages to using the database for such storage.( In this case, I 'm using postgres).
2475;negative;but i 'm afraid the cacheobject would get gc'ed not the data it caches.
2476;positive;Wrote it down for you, hope it works as you expected!
2477;positive;Great! Thank you.
2478;positive;but PROPN is awesome!
2479;positive;PROPN PROPN :-)
2480;neutral;As said by PROPN below, this is all mapped to a command named" PROPN. PROPN". Instead of using an uncomfortable shortcut, you can find the command and remap it to something that makes sense to you!
2481;neutral;PROPN is a part of Rails, but it 's not dependent on Rails. You can install it into PROPN without installing all of Rails by using` gem PROPN xml- simple`.
2482;positive;If you do n't mind working at a slightly lower level, httplib2() is an excellent PROPN library that includes caching functionality.
2483;neutral;See related discussion at
2484;negative;I have an .ico file with 5 icon sizes embedded in it being used as the main application icon and the PROPN PROPN icon. When it shows up in the task bar the icon is using the 16x16 format which is desired. When the icon shows up in the PROPN PROPN/ PROPN tray, it is using the 32x32 format and PROPN is rendering it down to a 16x16 icon, which looks horrible. How do I force windows to use the 16x16 icon size in the notification area? Here 's my code to put the icon in the system tray:
2485;positive;To get the width of the image you can use this code: You could use this in the document preamble to create a new command to automatically set the width: and then, in your document: I hope this helps!
2486;neutral;agree, PROPN is totally useless for this
2487;negative;that 's an awful lot of swapping hold and pattern spaces ...
2488;negative;I 'm developing a propietary( non PROPN PROPN) PROPN PROPN in PROPN, and I want to use the PROPN And Feel of PROPN( images, control distribution, etc.). Is this illegal? I 'm violating the license doing this?
2489;negative;The fact that this is even remotely possible in PROPN scares me.
2490;neutral;I 've run into this problem a couple times now. Last time, I wanted to create an array of arrays( matrix) of PROPN 's. I ended up encapsulating them in NSStrings, because apparently PROPN only has arrays of objects. This time, want an array of arrays again, but of CGPoints. I 'm going to be using these to draw images to the screen. Is there a way to create an array of CGPoints without them being objects? Should I even worry about the memory/ performance overhead of having a matrix of 96 objects?
2491;positive;Thanks! This looks very promising!
2492;neutral;In PROPN 4.0, most of you probably know you do n't need to explicitly write getters and setters for your Property declarations as follows: PROPN automatically creates private member variables called_ PROPN and_ Foo2. It seems as though PROPN and the PROPN team have adopted the PROPN convention, so I do n't see an issue with it.
2493;neutral;More popular duplicate    has in answer some handy tools not mentioned here.
2494;neutral;Indeed, but OP asked for a character not a substring. Of course if you interpret character broadly to include multibyte characters,` strstr` is the right function to use.
2495;neutral;We have a servlet hosted on jboss which works on PROPN. But sometimes we receieve requests that do not get decoded by jboss, and when we do PROPN on PROPN, we get null. The jboss access log shows the url in encoded form. Normally, when everything works smooth, url is shown decoded in access log. e.g.: This was a problematic request: This was a proper request: Could we be missing some jboss decode settings, or is it just a case of malicious user?
2496;neutral;I use a custom to check if text is numeric. Then when I bind a to a numeric property, I add the new custom class to the collection. In the example below the validation rule is checked everytime the changes.
2497;negative;I wondered if it 's possible to set the editor windows PROPN width in eclipse. I hate it when I want to close several windows in a row and I always have to move the mouse. Can I set eclipse to use only ONE width for every window tab?
2498;positive;Wow! I have an idea of cool web 2.0 app, and i will share it with you now. Do you remember this PROPN strip: So, imagine the web- service on which high- school students list people they dated( links to facebook profiles or smth), and the service provides recommendations whom to date next to create symmetric graph or any other fancy graph configuration.
2499;neutral;I know this does n't answer your question directly, but it might be worth checking out the PROPN PROPN 2005 migration tool for PROPN. I 've never used the tool, but it might be worth using with PROPN PROPN 2005 PROPN PROPN to see if there are the same issues as you had with MySQL
2500;positive;PROPN- In regard to' being more careful in the future' I 've really enjoyed using PROPN within my PROPN PROPN 2010. It 's done an excellent job of helping me perform perfect commits
2501;positive;Thanks, that 's great additional info PROPN!
2502;positive;Text to html and PROPN are really different things. A real time preview is cool feature ... i 've seen a great example somewhere :) hmm PROPN here, at PROPN!
2503;neutral;Make it work with all browsers up front. This will mean extra testing during development but will cause you less pain later. I find it 's usually easier to diagnose problems if I 've just developed the thing, rather than coming back later and trying to figure it out ... along with a list of other issues.
2504;neutral;I have n't done this before, but I found on the web giving an explanation.
2505;negative;I 'm afraid you 're wrong.
2506;positive;great thanks! serverfault.com- the new server admin equivalent of stackoverflow!
2507;negative;Ran into this myself. Very annoying limitation PROPN.
2508;positive;Already answered to wrap it but here 's an. Good luck!
2509;negative;writing a stream manipulator is a very complicated way of doing something very simple!
2510;neutral;1) Make sure PROPN engine is 1.5 and there 's no PROPN server running on this seme box on the port you expected fb 1.5. 2) Make sure you do n't have any PROPN called' substring' registered inside this PROPN so that PROPN is especting different params.
2511;positive;My test page: My PROPN trunk/ PROPN/ sifr_config.js My CSS trunk/ css/ sifr.css any and all help would be greatly appreciated!
2512;neutral;how can an answer be accepted when it answers a different question?
2513;positive;This describes one type of UUID in great details and I have used a similar approach with great success when I needed a UUID implementation and could not link to an existing library for architectural reasons. This provides a good overview.
2514;positive;255 projects! WOW! well I can see that happening for what you do ...
2515;positive;Thanks for the answers guys, all where to me really useful! :)
2516;neutral;Just making a note that this answer is now out of date. The feature is available.
2517;negative;I have an existing javascript/ flash -interaction kludge that sucks terribly. Now I 've decided it 'd be better to write a flash app that does the specific thing without the need to interact with javascript. Therefore I 'd need to produce flash apps in PROPN, and I do n't have money to throw at adobe right now( perhaps never if their software keeps being terrible). Also not going to do software development on windows, have been there, conclusion: that 's not going to work well ever. So, any solutions? Free or open source?
2518;positive;I started wondering today if it would be possible to integrate PROPN with PROPN apps. If that would be possible we could have one great product! The first thing that I would want to integrate is the logon- process, one login for Joomla+Google apps. Then it would be great to have some PROPN apps modules:- your latest e- mails- your next calendar entries- your PROPN talk buddies PROPN/ offline- your most recent docs and spreadsheets
2519;positive;Awesome work guys. Got to love the fact that the PROPN community are so fast that issues I ca n't solve alone do n't particularly impact on my day! Thanks! :)
2520;positive;Have you tried: I 've also seen samples that in the markup for the media display PROPN file they specify an element such as: PROPN Luck!
2521;positive;Excellent advice here, and it seems like you know know this field. I hope you 'll keep participating.
2522;neutral;Seems that it has moved to PROPN:
2523;positive;PROPN! Truly awesome, SQLite to the power! :)
2524;negative;That was a terrible article, it started out right, PROPN- PROPN/ PROPN shuffle, then goes horribly wrong by trying to randomly order using PROPN as a source of randomness. Do n't waste your time and just read the PROPN article on PROPN- Yates or use a library that implements shuffle correctly.
2525;neutral;Are both native libraries packaged into a signed jar which is listed as In the PROPN file?
2526;neutral;Wo n't work well if the files are not after each other though?
2527;neutral;If you are not totally tied to pure C and can use string.h there is PROPN()
2528;neutral;In PROPN, for example, the @Override annotation not only provides compile- time checking of an override but makes for excellent self- documenting code. I 'm just looking for documentation( although if it 's an indicator to some checker like pylint, that 's a bonus). I can add a comment or docstring somewhere, but what is the idiomatic way to indicate an override in PROPN?
2529;negative;PROPN: When PROPN or PROPN say" undefined" they usually mean" crash" or" memory corruption" or something equally terrible. Beware.
2530;neutral;If you can use PROPN, there is little point to needing to worry about a PROPN scripting solution.
2531;neutral;- I know the exact contents of the PROPN files so I do n't have to worry about escaping characters, etc ..- I used dotTrace by PROPN for PROPN.- I actually use PROPN PROPN PROPN in other parts of my code- Performance is important in this piece of code, which was the reason I asked
2532;negative;Is there a sensible way to group PROPN PROPN dates by PROPN? I would Mod them by 86400 but that does n't take leap seconds into account. Does anyone have any other ideas, I 'm using java so I could parse them into PROPN Objects, but I 'm a little worried of the performance overhead of using the date class. Also is there a more efficient way than comparing the year month and day parts of a PROPN object?
2533;negative;I do hate the plain PROPN d name. I strongly prefer to always use the PROPN or a variant thereof. I always know which table is the authoritative table for the PROPN PROPN when I need to, but this confuses me What 's worst of all is the mix you mention, totally confusing. I 've had to work with a database where almost always it was foo_id except in one of the most used ids. That was total hell.
2534;positive;Very good one, thanks!!
2535;positive;Like others I 'm using larger fonts, since getting on the plus side of fifty. Most recently I started using the PROPN typeface and have really enjoyed it. Fixed width indents well. The clear differences between lowercase PROPN and number 1 and the letter O and PROPN 0 for example also makes this a really good programming font.
2536;neutral;If you are using GUIDs you could create a PROPN table with columns PROPN, PROPN, PROPN. For populating the table you would still have to create a trigger for every table or handle it in the application logic.
2537;neutral;Given that my client code knows everything it needs to about the remoting object, what 's the simplest way to connect to it? This is what I 'm doing at the moment:
2538;negative;When running graphics based programs in PROPN for PROPN( PROPN) the error messages and the output of the print statement( i.e. stdout) are hidden. If due to an error application stops working as expected its lost and tracking down the bug is very difficult, sometimes require running a" second stripped version" of the code. This is obviously painful. How do I log those errors to a file, so that I may see them later.
2539;neutral;Is it possible to create images with PROPN( as opposed to simply linking to them via PROPN) and if so, where should I go first to learn about such a thing?
2540;positive;That migration doc was essential for me, great link!
2541;neutral;In C#, if I wanted to parse out a string into a date and timespan, I 'd do something similar to the following: My PROPN- PROPN has been less than desirable in finding a way to convert this to PROPN- PROPN Any suggestions?
2542;neutral;I have an PROPN web server that is hosting two application pools. Occasionally, one of the w3wp processes will spike the CPU for a while, and both app pools seem to suffer the consequences. I 'm not sure which one is which, and without that information I do n't know which application to blame. How can I tell which w3wp belongs to which PROPN PROPN?
2543;positive;Just use PROPN. It 's free, it has excellent chatting capabilities, works over firewalls, supports lots of collaboration features out of box and plenty more as plugins. PROPN It is also supported natively on PROPN PROPN and has good clients on other mobile platforms( like Fring on PROPN)
2544;negative;I hate it too. But did you stop to think why i wanted to do this instead of just assuming i m an idiot? Its a small personal site, not a money maker. Rebuilt it to learn a new technology. Not bothered 301ing pages to their new versions. So instead trying to get some value to the homepage.
2545;neutral;I wondering how in PROPN/ PROPN you can implement a program( similar to tail -f) that watches for new lines added to a log file and then process them?
2546;positive;Would it be possible for you to post the code here? That would be awesome!
2547;positive;I really liked learning PROPN at college. I find functional programming often a refreshingly elegant way to write certain algorithms. I have heard of PROPN# and played around with that a bit. Still, I 've written some interesting functions in PROPN and would like to integrate them as libraries I could use in other applications. Usually I paste my functions into the PROPN interpreter. Is there a way I can compile them down?
2548;positive;This is simple I hope :) When I create a new web application in PROPN does it need to be on port 80 if I want to point an external domain name at it? Everything is standard in terms of PROPN and ports that are open i.e. port 80 is the only one open. I am guessing if I let PROPN assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be accessed externally unless I open the assigned port? Cheers
2549;neutral;Would it help to create a View in your database that excludes the blob, and then generate your dbml from the view? It 's not too terribly different from your second option, but keeps the changes mainly in the database itself, without requiring any changes to your existing table structure.
2550;positive;+1 for*" ... the debate was about PROPN* what** was actually meta data."*
2551;neutral;i think that scope of' killed' is ok.
2552;negative;That link is full of horrible advice.
2553;neutral;I 've created an PROPN task to compile PROPN applications. After some preprocessing of the source files, I start with the appropriate parameters using But when I press Ctrl+C while PROPN is running, the script and my task are terminated but the spawned process is still running. How can I automatically terminate the process I started when the PROPN script gets terminated? What exactly happens if I press Ctrl+C? Is my task killed immediately or is there some way to react?
2554;neutral;@startec The question was about 4- byte floats. Which string ends with a comma? Only the tuple from` struct.unpack` has a comma.
2555;negative;PROPN PROPN .... PROPN!
2556;neutral;Does anyone have a recommendation for an excellent reference on PROPN 's PROPN( PROPN 2008 flavour) when used in local mode? I 'm currently using it but parts of it are a bit of a black box so I 'd like to read up on the entire subject. Especially want to start using sub- reports to display more complex parent- child reports. I 'm assuming they work in a similar mode to PROPN PROPN with which I 'm reasonably familar. Thanks, PROPN.
2557;neutral;That 's what I meant. He need n't worry about the response being returned .... you are correct about the PROPN PROPN.
2558;neutral;Another good reason is relative longevity. db40 is an excellent product for what it does, but its user base is small and it is n't likely to outlive something like PROPN PROPN. Of course, I also used to say there was no way PROPN was going to survive.
2559;negative;Yeah- my solution to this was to limit PROPN users- they can only select a tiny subset of the rows and columns that PROPN and PROPN users can. Even then PROPN only just copes with maybe 25 cells( PROPN grid), 7 and 6 remain hopeless. It brings back memories of late 90s web development and is an ugly thing to do, but what else can you do if their browser is so poor?
2560;neutral;PROPN, I 'm familiar with the* beforefieldinit*" optimization" but, personally, I never worry about it.
2561;neutral;See
2562;neutral;... as long as the user does n't enter a- or.
2563;neutral;Use` locale` and it 's string collation methods to sort naturally according to current locale.
2564;negative;Unfortunately, no. That 's my major pain when merging vcproj file changes.
2565;positive;Wow I frickin love this site! Thanks for the quick and concise responses. I plan to keep the client- side regex validation but move the username check to the server- side on submit.
2566;positive;Has anyone ever made a sharepoint lookup column that allows fill inn choices and does writeback to the list it does lookup from? what would it take to make such a column? If a 3.rd party solution is arround that would be realy great to :) PROPN!
2567;neutral;Fair enough: if your PROPN upgrade messes up PROPN, the clients of the your big boy PROPN( i.e. PROPN, PROPN, PROPN, etc.) should scream bloody murder( and I have). Admittedly the question was n't clear whether it was only about PROPN classes.
2568;negative;PROPN multi- core processors are still so rare, and threading is such a horrible and hairy and dangerous place to go, that you 're just better off sticking to one thread.
2569;neutral;I 've been using for a little while now, but there 's one glaring piece of functionality that is either missing or I just ca n't figure out( I hope the latter!). If you pass cfg.getTemplate() an absolute path, it just does n't work. I know you can specify a template directory, but I ca n't afford to do that, my use case could deal with files in any directory. Is there any way to set PROPN to render absolute paths the way any user would expect?
2570;positive;This is really simple and works great! I did a javascript test:
2571;neutral;More info at
2572;positive;I 've found the following macros pretty useful! So you can just call or from within your app( as long as the header is included of course!).
2573;negative;Is there a way to have mod_wsgi reload all modules( maybe in a particular directory) on each load? While working on the code, it 's very annoying to restart apache every time something is changed. The only option I 've found so far is to put below every import .. but that 's also really annoying since it means I 'm going to have to go through and remove them all at a later date ..
2574;neutral;We 'll eventually use PROPN PROPN when .NET 4.0 ships. However, in our production code right now we have had great success with a" PROPN" class along with common way to generate exceptions. For more details, see.
2575;neutral;You might want to check out the and methods. I 'm afraid the method for array objects performs a shallow comparison, and does not properly( at least for this case) compare the inner arrays.
2576;negative;Is it possible to use PROPN 's API to grab search results? For example, if I wanted my page to show all tweets( man I hate that term) with the word" cat" in it? Is it also possible to get just the matching results that were after a certain date?
2577;neutral;I want to format a XML document during unmarshal with JAXB. Unmarshal looks like: While marshaling one can format the code via: But this isn     t possible for the unmarchal process ... Any idea how I can format the XML string with JAXB during( or after) unmarshal process? BTW: I read some posts here about pretty print, but I want to do it with JAXB!
2578;positive;PROPN is pretty awesome- Also ASUnit- They are both pretty similiar and both haven taken quite a bit from frameworks like PROPN. PROPN() although I have n't used it myself seems to do PROPN unit testing.
2579;neutral;I 'm trying to build 3 packages, PROPN, PROPN and PROPN PROPN defines some base classes that are used in PROPN and PROPN I 've got all 3 of them in the same project group, all set up to output to the same custom BPL output folder. This folder is in the search path for PROPN and PROPN But when I go to build PROPN and PROPN, the compiler chokes on the Requires list." Required package' A' not found." How do I tell B and PROPN where to find A so they 'll build correctly?
2580;negative;One thing I forgot, make sure the dev database you are running the migration from( the sql server database) is updated from production immediately before each test run. Hate to have something fail on prod because you were testing against outdated records.
2581;neutral;I do n't believe there is a general J2ME API for determining location. I do know that PROPN has a specific API for retrieving not only the rough' cell' location, but also a PROPN API as well. I 'm afraid, at the moment, the PROPN solutions are proprietary by manufacturer.
2582;positive;You 've got to start with a custom instance of. We 'd prefer to implement the simpler, but in this scenario we need access to the underlying. Then, to wire it up in the iBATIS config: Hope this helps!
2583;negative;@Kev its a deployment headache, you can ilmerge it in ... but still its an extra bit of luggage you need to worry about
2584;neutral;Is it possible to add messages to the built- in error console of PROPN from PROPN code running in web pages? I know that I there 's PROPN, which provides a object and its own error console, but I was looking for a quick fix earlier on and could n't find anything. I guess it might not be possible at all, to prevent malicious web pages from spamming the log?
2585;negative;Hate to say it, but I do n't think there is a way to alleviate this. I do think that it depends on the client system, though, so a faster javascript engine or machine may make it slightly more accurate.
2586;negative;COM components are really a pain to manage, update, versioning, etc.
2587;neutral;While this is excellent advice, as other answers state, there is a more nuanced answer in the case of an immutable, safely published map instance. But you should do that only if You Know What You 're Doing.
2588;negative;Notably, the debugger shows the string* with* escape characters. When the string is printed in the console, the escape characters are not included." \"code\"" vs." code". This 100 character limit is very annoying as it prevents you from copying, say, a long JSON string and then immediately pasting that string( escape characters included) as a test string variable in your code.
2589;negative;i am also having this exact problem. large table, nested divs within table. PROPN renders PROPN page within 10 seconds, ie renders the table after a wait of 2 minutes. PROPN still zips along with teh drag and dtop, ie crawls .. infact it freezes, and the drag and drop sdoes not work. am going to try some of teh solutions below. the fixed width, and the# i d tagname.class references. But i do fear that it will still be slow. if anyone else has some good i deas, I would be all ears.
2590;positive;I 've been very happy with bulk- loader. We 've integrated it with PROPN 's PROPN and IoC frameworks-- with great success.
2591;positive;Can someone tell me how I go about upgrading the PROPN PROPN controls? I am currently using the PROPN 2008 release and I just recently bought the PROPN 2009 PROPN release. How do I upgrade my projects? Do I need to uninstall the old one and install the new one or just install the new one? Also how do my projects get upgraded? Also, what about my projects that I have" live"? Do I just need to upload the new DLLs and and change my web.config? Any guidance would be great!
2592;negative;I 'm developing an PROPN application() that runs with LSUIElement set( system menu only- no tray icon, does n't appear in PROPN- tab). It works totally fine, but someone just pointed out that it has a blank process name in the PROPN PROPN listing. Just says nothing. Everything else in there has a name. Even other apps running at PROPN. I 've tried to search around the web, but I ca n't spot anyone talking about this. What on earth should I be looking for?
2593;positive;Excellent answer, worked for me.
2594;neutral;Does it make any difference if you go
2595;positive;I 've got a table with a PROPN collum. What I want to do is get it to be able to pick out words and list them in order. For example if it contained: PROPN PROPN likes cheese but loves reading PROPN likes chocolate milk PROPN loves manga but also likes cookies Then I would get likes loves as a result ... is this possible and if so how? I 'd like to be able to do it in just mysql alone, but I can use php as well. Thanks in advance, PROPN
2596;neutral;The PROPN PROPN has got better( and smaller) in PROPN 4 see
2597;neutral;If you 're using a general- purpose method which has the signature that 's called from any event handler and is passed both the and, it can call, e.g., for logging events, without worrying about a null pointer exception.
2598;neutral;
2599;positive;I am trying to make Authlogic and PROPN PROPN( using PROPN) play nice so that you can create an account either the normal registration way or with PROPN connect. I have been able to get the connect to work one way but logging out only loggs out on facebook and not on my site, I have to delete the cookies to make it working. Any help would be awesome, thank you!
2600;neutral;My advice is to not even worry about it. HTML and PROPN, unlike most languages, are almost trivial to re- indent to any style the programmer wants. In PROPN I use width-2 tabs, and regularly have sections that run off the edge of the editor window. There 's not really any way to avoid that unless you just skip indenting sections of the document.
2601;neutral;@sll: Not True ... See my Edit
2602;positive;An excellent and elegant solution. Kudos.
2603;positive;I have done some research for" The bast way to insert huge data into PROPN with C#" then a lot of people just suggested me using SqlBulkCopy. After I tried it out and it really amazed me. Undoubtedly, SqlBulkCopy is very very fast. It seems that SqlBulkCopy is a perfect way to insert data( especially huge data). But why do nt we use it at all times. Is there any drawback of using SqlBulkCopy?
2604;neutral;A better, more common practice is to put in the PROPN PROPN only the items that can be selected. It wo n't prevent keyboard usage( I, as a user, would find this offensive!) and simplify code.
2605;neutral;encryption/ decryption of the relevant code as well, and emit the PROPN. This would be another layer of obscurity that although does n't ultimately protect you really, it does make it a little more of a pain. Also, post your question at reverse-engineering.net forums and see what those crackers say.
2606;neutral;I 'd just keep creating my own dependency properties, personally. It really is n't much extra work, and then you do n't have to worry about any of the possible caveats.
2607;neutral;PROPN Why, then, did he invoke" PROPN 's dictum"? PROPN 's paper was more about clarity than about optimization. The quote never actually appears in the paper; rather, he wrote" In our previous discussion we concluded that premature emphasis on efficiency is a big mistake which may well be the source of most programming complexity and grief".
2608;positive;Wow that 's a very interesting question! I 'm not exactly a pro at 16- bit C++ so I wonder why do you swap stacks at all?
2609;positive;Thanks! Both you and PROPN were very helpful!
2610;neutral;I 'm thinking of creating a small offline blog editor for personal use and I do n't know how do the APIs work. Where can I find this information? I 'm particularly looking for the most common providers: PROPN, PROPN, PROPN, PROPN PROPN( not sure if this has an API) etc.
2611;neutral;I have added a reference to an excellent article showing to go about it.
2612;positive;Excellent question. PROPN this type of thinking makes programs much more robust, especially when they undergo constant change.
2613;positive;I am new to .NET in general, so I hope this is n't too n00b of a question. I 'm looking to write a PROPN app that interacts with a PROPN PROPN using PROPN. Do I absolutely, positively have to use a seperate PROPN service? It seems there are security implications, but this would be on a completely trusted network. Thanks in advance
2614;negative;This algorithm is terribly inefficient for small sample chosen from a large set. Picking 5 integers from a million takes one million calls to PROPN() instead of 5.
2615;positive;I am a newbie in flex. Latest task is to generate a graph or a netwrok based on the data input. What is the best way to do it. Also when clicked on a node of a network it should show the associated data with that node. Hope to get some help soon! Thanks, PROPN
2616;negative;I often need to execute custom PROPN queries in django, and manually converting query results into objects every time is kinda painful. I wonder how fellow Slackers deal with this. Maybe someone had written some kind of a library to help dealing with custom PROPN in PROPN?
2617;negative;The move to version 7 is painful, I totally agree. Our process has taken just as long( and seems to be stretching out forever)- especially coming away from PROPN PROPN into individual v7 products.
2618;negative;What 's the easiest static( non- animating) 3d model format to load with PROPN? I used .obj in PROPN, but that 's a pain to do in java. Is there anything better?
2619;neutral;I would n't class that a problem. If you structure things in a meaningful way, you should be able to look at the PROPN, see where all the event hooks are. If you 're worried too much about it, you* could* set the PROPN attr to PROPN, or prepent the PROPN with PROPN PROPN, etc.
2620;positive;I 'm learning PROPN, then i was searching for some codes for learn something in the area that i love: PROPN I/ PROPN, but i want to know how i can tweak my code for the user type the file that he wants to see, like in wget, but with my program like this: The code of my program is here: Thanks!
2621;neutral;Sharepoint recognize file types using their extensions. If you are worried about users spreading malicious application/ code in your PROPN PROPN. I suggest you to take a look at. You can modify the excluded extension list under PROPN PROPN> Operations> PROPN PROPN PROPN.
2622;negative;In netbeans, if I select some text and press, it works correctly and the text is indented to the right side as expected. But if I then try to backspace behind the text, it only removes one space at a time. Very annoying. Is there any way to change this setting, so backspacing behind a tabbed line causes the whole tab to be removed and not just 1 space?
2623;negative;It 's a terrible idea to include a using directive in a header file too. This simply mitigates that problem.
2624;neutral;Why do you hate PROPN?
2625;positive;Great answer! But as PROPN mentioned,` auto` now has a different meaning, so could you please update the table at the end?
2626;negative;Do n't want to beat a dead horse, but it is really important that you understand that this is a terrible idea.
2627;neutral;A few months ago the PROPN PROPN blog reported on some platform with an atrociously bad sorting algorithm. If you have to use that platform then you sure do want to implement your own instead.
2628;negative;PROPN is a terrible and wondrous thing. I 'm still trying to figure out the" data" object structure when using group fields PROPN
2629;negative;In general, this is a_ terrible_ idea. PROPN headers are not intended to be included in an alternately namespace as was used here.
2630;neutral;I want to be able to play sound files in my program. Where should I look?
2631;negative;can you help? i have a PROPN, the unique identifiers are PROPN- we need to implement URL rewriting however the page names look terrible for example: PROPN title of page/ unique identifier my PROPN 's that i setup i use Ints as unique identifiers so i never had this problem: testpage-1.aspx title of page/ unique identifier( int) what do you suggest?
2632;positive;PROPN. It 's super efficient too!
2633;neutral;Actually, thinking about it, i think it had to do with PROPN. I think PROPN choked when trying to render the sitecore stuff
2634;neutral;I want to to do this, on an 8- bit micro controller with the least possible number of instructions.
2635;positive;We use PROPN 's 3.0 PROPN( pro version .. but free version is excellent) more extensively than probably anybody. It has the flexibility to handle more things than the other grids .. in my opinion of course. Try them all, there are limitations to each.
2636;neutral;Does anyone know how to print a barcode to the PROPN PROPN bluetooth printer from a PROPN PROPN PROPN application> We are currently using the PROPN PROPN API but have been unable to find a way to print a barcode.
2637;neutral;Ramesh- I would implement this using supertype and subtype relationships in my E- R model. There are a few different physical options you have of implementing the relationships as well.
2638;positive;I have been using( and loving) the PROPN intellisense for PROPN PROPN 2008( blogged about by PROPN PROPN) but has any one ever come across an intellisense script for the components of PROPN? Thanks!
2639;negative;Would 've loved to. But there is no hash_map in the PROPN standard library, and PROPN 's do n't allow code outside of that.
2640;positive;This looks really useful, thanks!
2641;negative;I have one of the PROPN keyboards with their PROPN lock ... man I hate that thing.
2642;neutral;It depends on your PROPN, PROPN, PROPN, and possibly other factors. In general it means the PROPN bus could not complete a command, or suffered a conflict, but that could mean a whole range of things depending on the environment and code being run.
2643;neutral;I have a video player that loads progressive flv video from a server and applies a reflection to it. I do this by creating a bitmapData object and then drawing the video to it. This worked absolutely fine until we moved our content from testing server to PROPN PROPN. Now there is no reflection. Can anyone explain why this is happening and even suggest a solution? PROPN. i am using PROPN 8 PROPN. thanks
2644;neutral;@Lance: the first one is also executing. Compare it with a named constructor: this is actually also executing code. The same goes for the anonymous constructor ... But that was not the question ;-)
2645;neutral;Why do people use"* PROPN" instead of just typing" unix"? Are you afraid of a trademark lawsuit?
2646;positive;There 's an RFC for how to read RFCs. Love it!
2647;neutral;Methods that are not' const' will most likely change the state of the object. That is exactly the reasoning behind object orientation: you call operations that do stuff, and you do n't have to worry about the object 's internal state.
2648;neutral;I have two arrays of animals( for example). How can I merge the two arrays into one by the PROPN?
2649;negative;I am currently developing a system on a server running PROPN version PROPN thus I am forced to use PROPN 1.1 in the current environment. I am planning to migrate the application from 1.1 to 1.2 in the somewhat near future and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this? I have attempted to migrate a system from 1.0 to 1.1 and that was a major pain in the rear. How has it been for anyone out there migrating from PROPN 1.1 to 1.2?
2650;positive;I agree- this is a very good introduction to PROPN and PROPN!
2651;neutral;I would say you should be worried about using primitives over wrappers only when you profile your application and see that the autoboxing is a performance or memory issue. In my experience memory becomes an issue before CPU cycles when talking about primitives vs wrapping objects.
2652;positive;Great, thank you, that fixed my issue!
2653;positive;This is great! Thanks +1
2654;negative;I ca n't help think that making XML ad XMLList both unrelated, as in both extend PROPN directly, is a design flaw in the PROPN core library. Surely having XML extend XMLList would be a much cleaner system, where XML is considered an XMLList with only one member? This would also avoid the very annoying practice of an PROPN query possibly returning either an XML or XMLList, which can result in a casting error. So is there any reason I 'm not thinking of that PROPN and PROPN were designed to only have Object as a common type?
2655;positive;I 'd really love the surrounding content to" scroll" up/ down in like when using PROPN- but would also love the appropriate PROPN to" fade" in.
2656;neutral;if the 2 structures variable are initialied with PROPN or they are set with 0 by memset so you can compare your 2 structures with PROPN and there is no worry about structure garbage and this will allow you to earn time
2657;neutral;I too advise to use the simple way( KISS!-) -- but some optimization could be found, namely not to test the length of an array more than once:
2658;neutral;I 've got a project using PROPN 2 as the build tool. I use PROPN 6 as my PROPN and really want to be able to use the profiler. How can I get this to work?
2659;negative;I have various files that I want to be ignored by PROPN when committing. I know that I can go into TortoiseSVN and ignore them in various ways. I know that I can run svn PROPN PROPN: ignore from the command line to do the same thing. The problem is that I have to have everyone on my team to do that, which is a pain. Is there a way that I can put some file in a folder or set something in my SVN repository that tells it to never check a certain file in?
2660;positive;I have a gridview with rows that can be edited, inserted etc. I wrapped it in an updatepanel to give it an AJAX effect and update the system without reloading the page. I recently got into using PROPN and webservices for my PROPN calls and I absolutely love how it works and how fast it is. I would like to know if it is possible, and if so then how, to update my gridview using PROPN PROPN methods.
2661;negative;PROPN, I assume some people already hate you just for asking. And they have a point.
2662;positive;this one is great!
2663;positive;A great explanation! Thanks :)
2664;positive;I intended to post this quote. It is very true :-)
2665;neutral;does n't work with copy/ paste
2666;neutral;if all you have is the PROPN, how would you know which table it came from?
2667;neutral;My project has an object that creates a process. It this object 's Dispose function, it kills the process( or tries to). However, if the program crashes, it leaves the process running and does n't clean up. Which causes the program to fail next time because it tries to launch the process again and ca n't get a lock on it. How can I make sure this process is killed? I always use the object that creates the process in a block For reference I 'm using C# and .NET 3.5
2668;positive;I 've got tables like this: I want to merge them like: In this new table, PROPN in PROPN. Articles will belong to PROPN column, because .. Articles. PROPN and PROPN. Title mean the same thing :) Any answers will be very appreciated :) Thanks
2669;neutral;I 'm trying to follow and similar tutorials. I 've got a custom SPJobDefinition derivative and a feature. The definition does n't do anything yet, since I 'm just trying to get it setup. The feature has the following code in the PROPN: What am I missing? It all deploys fine, and the feature activates fine, but it does n't show up in the list of job definitions!
2670;positive;Great sample code!
2671;neutral;i wonder what is the purpose for designer to monkey with your properties ...
2672;negative;I have a class, let 's call it PROPN, that renders a line graph. I need to subclass it, but the derived class is only used in one place and is coupled to the class that uses it. So I am using an inner class. I see two ways to do this: Anonymous inner class Named inner class I am not a fan of anonymous inner classes, because frankly I just think it looks really ugly. But in the case of a subclass that 's only used in one place, is a named inner class overkill? What is the accepted practice?
2673;neutral;link is now updated
2674;positive;Hey, I 'm new to this site. I think it is great! Okay, here 's the deal. I just downloaded PROPN PROPN. I was wondering how they made it so you can upload a song to the cloud. I might have an app idea that might incorporate this. How would I do this? What would I need?
2675;neutral;I have two arrays of PROPN. Data. PROPN objects which I want to compare. The rows have two columns PROPN and PROPN PROPN PROPN is a key and I want to find out which rows have had their B column changed and which rows have been added or deleted. How do I do this in PROPN?
2676;neutral;You can also detect malicious bots, which would n't respect robots.txt using.
2677;negative;Currently the msbuild logs for team PROPN are appalling as they are just plain text and are very difficult to read. Also the ones created by my build are PROPN 30Mb and take quite a while to download( our PROPN server is in our datacentre). Does anyone know any way of being able to view these logs easier, prefereably integrated with either PROPN itself or PROPN PROPN?
2678;positive;There is reference information available on the PROPN website. If you want more of an introduction or tutorial, then PROPN PROPN 's book is excellent.
2679;positive;The is an excellent resource for locale data. From the website you can download an xml version of the database, which includes datetime formats, number formats, and lots of other locale specific data.
2680;positive;I ca n't comment( yet) so I have to add my comment this way. I thing PROPN PROPN PROPN 's advice is the best for PROPN(). PROPN, what a lovely girl he 's got btw. I 've tried his approach in PROPN and I succeeded basically doubling the input tags in this way: This way the 1st element is hidden but it CATCHES the display focus PROPN would give to the 2nd input element instead. PROPN IT!
2681;neutral;This suffers from the race condition of having another process started between querying the system for it and returning to the caller saying it was n't found. Using the mutex approach is one way around it.
2682;negative;Some more depressing news here:
2683;neutral;Also look at the" PROPN PROPN", works excellent with those classic asp tag cloud.
2684;neutral;Is there any difference between: and The convention that I 've seen in most PROPN code( and the code I myself write) is the former, but I recently came across code which uses the latter. None is an instance( and the only instance, PROPN) of PROPN, so it should n't matter, right? Are there any circumstances in which it might?
2685;neutral;Try[ castor](   mapping.
2686;positive;The documentation of PROPN is really great and not that hard to understand.
2687;positive;Almost works. You have to seek to one less then write a byte, otherwise you still end up with a 0B file. Still very helpful, thanks! Correct PROPN too. If you want to edit, the extra line you need is PROPN. PROPN);
2688;positive;I did some research on this a few years ago( 2005 I believe) and I liked JNBridgePro as the best third party product to do this. Check it out here Good luck!
2689;positive;Very nice articles!
2690;neutral;yes -- it offers no benefit. depends on what you 're used to, I 'm sure. No, it 's just a constant -- not an abuse.
2691;positive;Version 2 of contains a debugger. And it works awesome! It is still in very early stages, but have helped me several times. Just watch out for bugs! :)
2692;negative;( and even worse, the+ or- 10 is dependant on the order of registering the observers!)
2693;positive;If it has a lot of cup holders, that 'd be awesome, too!
2694;neutral;If you want to be really paranoid, you can install VPN clients on every computer, and have a off- site VPN server at a datacenter ... But that eats into your bandwidth, and is probably more complexity than you want to put up with.
2695;negative;I have a page that uses excanvas to draw some images. While testing the new page in PROPN, one computer attempts to open office 2000 and install a missing component. If the office 2000 install is canceled the vml images appear. This problem only happens on one of my test machines but it still worries me. Anyone seen this issue when using PROPN and excanvas before?
2696;neutral;You could flatten that hierarchy down to: or .. It 'd make life a bit less painful doing PROPN queries. I also added an PROPN PROPN attribute so you can uniquely identify an activity.
2697;neutral;here, bro:
2698;neutral;I need to keep the files& folders on two PROPN- based, non- domain machines synchronized across a public network. I was thinking rsync over PROPN- but I was wondering if there is a simpler solution? Any possibility of using the sync framework over PROPN/ PROPN/ PROPN? Or I 'm open to better ideas?
2699;neutral;Back in the private beta( this question dates back to about a week after the private beta began) the discussion aspect of the site was not terribly well- formed. I did n't really want to state an opinion, merely state an alternative approach. I think the pros and cons have been adequately addressed in the other answers/ posts.
2700;neutral;I am about to reenter the PROPN world after years away for a new job. What resources to people recommend for refreshing the memory? I have been doing mainly C# recently. Also any PROPN centric websites or blogs that people recommend?
2701;neutral;Unless you 're writing code for a really critical inner loop( simulator core, ray- tracer, etc.) there is no point in worrying about any performance hits in this case. There are other more important things to worry about in your code( and other more significant performance traps lurking, I 'm sure).
2702;neutral;Is there documentation or an article on the rules for passing strings into PROPN functions? I just trying to do some string concatenation/ formatting, but it 's putting all the parameters into the first placeholder. PROPN PROPN
2703;negative;Does anyone commit PROPN to their own source control? If so, how do you do it? Do you commit the whole PROPN directory or do you pick only the ones that your application needs( PROPN/ PROPN/ include/ src) How do you handle the case when new PROPN version comes out? I 'm asking because I 'm trying to setup PROPN automation and PROPN PROPN is a bit of a pain ... and just wondering how people handle committing 3rd party library in general.
2704;neutral;In PROPN PROPN 2005, set auto create statistics and auto update statistics. You wo n't have to worry about creating them or maintaining them yourself, since the database handles this very well itself.
2705;positive;PROPN( PROPN& PROPN I just looked at the jquery solution: add a hidden element to the DOM containing every conceivable tag and then reverse engineer the geometry conventions. The web is truly amazing place!
2706;positive;Good luck with your image processing adventures! I found it very fulfilling on a technical level when I was in that area :)
2707;positive;Your library should be named, with symlinks of and both pointing to that. The library should be created using in the linker command line( or on the gcc command line). Hope that helps!
2708;positive;A List PROPN is a great site, I recommend it heavily! I 've also used this article in the past:
2709;negative;Sorry to be a pain, but I have 2 questions. 1) But where is the log? I assumed that it would be in$ ftpreturn. 2) How do I check the bytes sent?
2710;negative;The PROPN is hopelessly broken. PROPN does n't do a thing ... and I 'm evidently not the only one with this problem:    So ... anyone have a workaround? The one posted in that thread just moved all the toolbars to the bottom of the window.
2711;neutral;Actually the link to PROPN Into PROPN should be[ this](
2712;neutral;Example: and return different results
2713;neutral;this is an old question- why has n't' PROPN PROPN' picked an answer yet?
2714;positive;Excellent handle :)
2715;neutral;Wo n't the guilty party simply increase the minimum amount that they 'll try? I know they 're trying to fly under the radar of the banks and on bank statements, but these days 10- 20 is a more common amount to see on your statement than 2.35. Do you have specific experience with this?
2716;neutral;The PROPN is most likely the solution, but if it still gives you grief, you can directly access your static resource by calling the following code after your list gets updated:
2717;neutral;
2718;positive;I 'm using PROPN PROPN 's repository pattern also- absolutely love it. But i 'm not worrying about concurrency checks. I load the most recent object, then update the fields the submitchanges. I would look at seeing if you could use the PROPN and/or timestamps. It 's been a while since i 've looking into linq+ concurrency.
2719;neutral;with the interoperability approach( wsdl- first), are you still hand coding the PROPN? If so, are you still running into the same pain points you 've described? Or have you have you found a better solution?
2720;negative;I ended up writing a python parser myself. I managed to do it by following the spec here: And then taking the code tables from the PROPN cvs. The open mobile alliance 's site and documentation are terrible, this was a very trying project :(
2721;neutral;I would go the custom Attached property route! should be pretty simple to implement too!
2722;positive;I 've handled the 404 by doing this in the global.asax file Now, if anyone can help me with the PROPN widget that would be great!
2723;positive;We are currently using PROPN to automatically build features and our complete product. It works quite well. Make sure you use the right script for product build or feature build. EDIT: We 've now migrated to, which has an excellent command line interface.
2724;negative;The method in .NET returns a by- ref version of a type, e.g. passing the type of returns a type representing. However, if you already have a, what is the mechanism for obtaining a plain old? There does n't seem to be an opposite method to remove the by- ref modifier. At the moment I 've put a hack in place which re- builds the assembly- qualified name without an at the end of the type name and then loads that type, but this is horribly dirty ...
2725;negative;@sixlettervariables: No, I 'm not asking. I 'm scared of the answer.
2726;neutral;the way memory handling works in C extension of python has nothing to do with PROPN, and is certainly not scope based. I wish it were, though, because as much as I hate PROPN, PROPN is the one thing that makes C++ better than PROPN in this area.
2727;neutral;I think I read somewhere recently( might even have been on SO but I ca n't find the question) that in a debug session, pressing stop in PROPN just kills the process and no PROPN takes place. However closing the app window normally performs PROPN as expected. Is this correct? Also, what happens when a( non- debug) process is killed in task manager- does the PROPN still cleanup?
2728;neutral;if efficiency is the case, I would use PROPN or on a personal preference- PROPN
2729;negative;Evaluation of what? I may be being slow today, but I really do n't understand what your problem is. I 'm awful tempted to vote to close on the principle that I do n't see a real question.
2730;neutral;Maybe the answers might just be more insightful if I remove the limitations ... I ca n't just" take the time" since there are a finite number of hours on this contract. Almost the entire code needs to be refactored. I am trying to identify the areas that will reduce the immediate pain.
2731;neutral;if the 2 structures variable are initialied with PROPN or they are set with 0 by memset so you can compare your 2 structures with PROPN and there is no worry about structure garbage and this will allow you to earn time
2732;negative;This is officially the first time I have seen it referred to as PROPN PROPN 's PROPN as opposed to PROPN PROPN PROPN. Sort of sad in a way
2733;neutral;I 'm using a PROPN validation for PROPN validation. I have defined this Template: The PROPN is located on a form in a PROPN. Everything works fine, but the'!' PROPN stays visible when I choose other PROPN. This behaviour is observed in many other cases- when expander expands etc .. the PROPN always stays visible on the same place, although the PROPN is not diplayed.
2734;positive;Excellent, the selected bit was very useful.
2735;negative;I have a main flash from PROPN i load another swf file from the server. From time to time i change the second swf file and want to load a fresh copy from the server. I clean the cache from the browser but my client does not know how to do that and it 's a pain to give him directions. If i want to load a fresh copy of the main swf i just add a" main.swf?version2" but i ca n't do that with the loadMovie function in flash. Any ideas how i can get a fresh copy from the server without changing the name of the file?
2736;neutral;I do n't think it 's a matter of which language is better. In the .NET world there are some inconsistencies between the libraries different languages provide. There are certain functionality that is available in PROPN that you might like to use from C# but ca n't. I remember I had to use J# to use some PROPN libraries that were not available in any other language in .NET.
2737;positive;loved your line NSIndexPath* indexPath=[ NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:0 PROPN];. +1 for you ;)
2738;neutral;x86 processors suffer a" partial register stall" if you, say, write to` ax` and then try to read from` eax`. Something to be aware of if you 're mixing 16- and 32- bit operations.
2739;positive;Great comment! In my case it does n't get larger than 64bit, but it is still interesting, what to do if it does? Why should I use" double" in such case?
2740;neutral;For the record, while I have seen an implementation where calling on a was PROPN), I have n't seen any PROPN implementations where calling on a was anything other than O(1) -- mainly because s are guaranteed to have random- access iterators. Even so, if you are worried about an inefficient, you can use this code:
2741;positive;I 'm writing a kernel( PROPN) module that uses a dynamic timer. I 'm using the timer_list structure as follows: This works ok for about 2 seconds until the timer expires. Then the system crashes. I 've also tried something like this with the same result: Any help would be greatly appreciated!
2742;neutral;Totally useless for PROPN( no anonymous PROPN delegates), but I can see it working with C#. Can you show how you foresee it being called?
2743;neutral;Do you need to worry about hitting the server with too many requests at once?
2744;neutral;If its just the quotes you are worried about, then just write a simple loop to dump character by character to a string ignoring the quotes. Alternatively if you are using some string manipulation library, you can use it to remove all quotes and then concatenate them.
2745;neutral;Do you have any PROPN in your application code? Then maybe you need to worry about 32 vs. 64 bit native binaries. 32 or 64 is all the same to your PROPN code. The performance aspects already seem well covered by previous posters.
2746;positive;+1 for calling out the binding method.
2747;neutral;I decided to simplify the reply marked as the answer on here to basically 2 lines using a LINQ expression.
2748;neutral;If using a numeric key, make sure the datatype is giong to be large enough to hold the number of rows you might expect the table to grow to. If using a guid, does the extra space needed to store the guid need to be considered? Will coding against guid PKs be a pain for developers or users of the application. If using composite keys, are you sure that the combined columns will always be unique?
2749;neutral;I can think of scenarios where initial sealing might be desirable until inheritance is required. I have some libraries that make use of the implied' sealed' knowledge to optimise some dynamic( run- time) processing( e.g. the knowledge that there is never going to be a derived class).
2750;positive;Although I did n't technically end up escaping the dot, your suggestion actually did make me realize another alternative. While wondering how I would" pass" the escape code to the" PROPN" server, it dawned on me: Why not use a" PROPN PROPN- Through PROPN" instead of an PROPN linked table? Since I only need read access to the PROPN PROPN data, it works fine! Thanks!
2751;negative;Why is this getting downvoted? He got the terms PROPN and compiler mixed up, but it 's still an excellent question. He wants to know if PROPN makes an official PROPN, like PROPN does with their PROPN products.
2752;neutral;If you do n't have alot of rows returned I 'll often use function. If its lots of rows, i 'll just do the query in PROPN PROPN and save as PROPN, PROPN types love excel for some reason.
2753;negative;I get the following when I build locally I get this error when building locally or on the team foundation server. Not exactly sure how to solve it, have the PROPN PROPN pool and web site running as the PROPN user so it does n't have any problem viewing the website but the error is really irritating as its always telling me my build is broken.
2754;neutral;You want the package.
2755;positive;We are using PROPN with great success. I had never seen it go above 2% CPU usage even during high load average.
2756;neutral;You could try using the PROPN< PROPN> tag instead of a link or a submit button. For example, The< PROPN> PROPN is much easier to style than the standard< input type="submit">. There are some cross- browser quirks but they are not insurmountable. A really great article about the use of< PROPN> can be found at particletree:
2757;positive;I made a template in my wiki called Template: quote, which contains the following content: Then I can use the template in a page, e.g.,{{ PROPN little test}} Works pretty well- Thanks!
2758;neutral;Instead of PROPN#, I would rather prefer PROPN() to convert my JARs to .NET assemblies as well as access PROPN APIs in C#.
2759;negative;PROPN PROPN config. As the guy said below, I imagine the file is just not being delivered correctly or something. Just worried something is breaking for my users!
2760;positive;It 's the answer to another question, but it was very helpful for me!
2761;neutral;The exclamation mark makes this question seem really exciting.
2762;neutral;This has been answered well here:  # 2066819
2763;neutral;The PROPN might be simple, but that 's only one part of the PROPN standard library. The iostreams library have nothing to do with( what was once) the PROPN. PROPN is basically contianers+ iterators+ algorithms. Iostreams, locales and all that has a completely different origin, and is generally a pain to work with ;)
2764;positive;I 'm just working my way through PROPN, and really liking it so far, but I have an issue and I 'm not sure what the typical way to solve it. Suppose I have a View which is supposed to be updated when some complex PROPN object is updated, but this object is not driven by the database, say it is driven by PROPN calls or directly by the user or something. Where does this code go? Should it still go in models.py????
2765;neutral;similar question:[ How to scroll to end of System. Windows. Forms. PROPN?](
2766;neutral;Another example from PROPN:
2767;positive;I have just come across this great API: However, I would like to also retrieve the continent. Is this even possible as I can not find it. Maybe there is another API that is freely available that will offer city, country and continent? I have tried PROPN PROPN API but they do n't offer continent either. Maybe I going to have to just convert what I already have into continents, how?! I hope this is n't too subjective! Thanks all
2768;neutral;One workaround is to store the client address in the session. A response wrapper should validate the client address set in the session is same as the one accessing the session.
2769;positive;I 've been using the PROPN PROPN PROPN/ PROPN PROPN with great success over the last couple months. I 've been given a new requirement to allow for a week to be selected( PROPN- PROPN) rather than a single day. Has anyone accomplished this before? highlighting by week rather than day show beginning date and ending date rather than single date in PROPN/ labels
2770;positive;PROPN PROPN has a great treatment of this exact topic in Items 26, 27 and 28," PROPN PROPN- time Dependencies, Parts 1, 2 and 3", in his excellent book PROPN PROPN, PROPN: 0201615622. PROPN, this is one of the best PROPN programming books available.
2771;neutral;Is there any way I can modify the URL of the current page without reloading the page? I would like to access the portion before the# hash if possible. I only need to change the portion after the domain, so its not like I 'm violating cross- domain policies.
2772;negative;Yes, I hate how PROPN tries to use port 80 ... I sometimes forget to change it, and then when I try to test some web thing I 've written, PROPN wo n't start.
2773;neutral;How about checking which week the first and last days will be in?
2774;neutral;As stated in the article linked in the question, the PROPN worker thread does indeed come from the runtimes thread pool.
2775;negative;PROPN got it. you did n't downvote me for simply asking you to explain a bit more did you?
2776;negative;I am trying to make a search PROPN with an embedded magnifying glass icon. I have the following markup so far: However, I ca n't find the entry in PROPN which will give me the same color as the standard PROPN border. This is a blueish color by default. Am I being really stupid here?   PROPN: btw, the image is contained in a stackpanel because I 'm planning to put a dropdown arrow in there as well.
2777;positive;Great links, thanks for your work!
2778;neutral;Having separate PROPN 's certainly makes it easier on the developers. We do that here for a set of projects( a set of data filters) with nearly identical I/ O requirements, and a common API. Each dev can go off and do his own thing without worrying about builds and conflicts.
2779;neutral;PROPN: According to PROPN employee PROPN PROPN" When desktop composition is enabled, DrawAnumatedRects is a nop in PROPN." So what do you use in PROPN and PROPN 7?
2780;positive;PROPN: I do n't think it 's the ONLY sane way to do it: p. Great answer though!
2781;positive;pagination is the same concept with or without PROPN. you just need your basic variables, then you can create the content you want. here 's some quasi- code: hope that helps you get started!
2782;positive;What an amazingly great answer. Way to go Cody!
2783;neutral;@grieve: Networking is native, meaning that when buffers are used the receive/ send data on the network, they are pinned in memory. see my comments below for elaboration.
2784;neutral;For windows 7/8  # 339475
2785;positive;Thanks for the link. That 's pretty cool!
2786;neutral;the' i PROPN' field of my table auto increases when I insert a row, I want to insert a row and then get that PROPN. I would do it just as I said it but I 'm wondering if there 's a way I can do it without worrying about the time between inserting the row and getting the i PROPN I know I can query the database for the row that matches the information that was entered, but there is a high change there will be duplicates, with the only difference being the PROPN PROPN
2787;neutral;Instead of logging to the console, log to a file and then track the file with a separate gui application. This keeps the console uncluttered and gives you a more persistent record of your log, which occasionally is extremely useful. There are various libraries which will do most of this for you, or you can keep it simple and just do it yourself.
2788;negative;Yes, PROPN, but* why*? It sound exactly what someone who develops a malicious piece of software would ask.
2789;neutral;Also, the question is why you want to move the column, the other 2 posters have summed up the how, but something about your attempted query worries me: 37 columns is far too many. If you 're trying to move a column on table with that many columns, i suspect you are PROPN
2790;positive;How can I get an array of pointers pointing to objects( classes)? I need to dynamically allocate space for them and the length of array is n't determined until run- time. Can any one explain and tell me how to define it? and possibly explain them how it works, would be really nice :)
2791;positive;PROPN( among many other meanings) is a** design pattern** -- see[ wikipedia](   for excellent coverage( not intensely PROPN specific, of course).
2792;positive;PROPN PROPN!
2793;positive;The effect I believe you are seeking is achieved by providing a PROPN for the PROPN 's in you PROPN collection. Hope this helps!
2794;negative;I am trying to save a PROPN from a .NET 3.5 PROPN 2007 PROPN PROPN to a new sheet( done) and save that new sheet to a new workbook( done) without that workbook requiring the VSTO customization file(!!!!!). Has anyone had any luck with this? The only way I 've had any success is just saving as a CSV file but that 's not exactly acceptable in this case. I 'd rather not save to a CSV just to copy back to a PROPN file. PROPN. SaveAs(saveDialog. PROPN, PROPN. PROPN)
2795;positive;When explaining things to someone who seems to still be learning PROPN, I 'd avoid using( or even showing) the pointless style. Do n't want to scare them ;-)
2796;positive;Always open in my editor is a tab with a text version of PROPN 's manual( ~100k lines in a readable layout), which is extremely helpful. The version I have is very old( when 5.0 was still in beta), and this valuable text- file does not exist in mysql.com anymore. Is there a newer version, or some tool that can create it out of the various existing formats?
2797;neutral;What is your question? What is not working as it should?
2798;positive;Awesome! You have no idea how long I 've been trying to find this!
2799;neutral;I have a page with many forms in panels and usercontrols, and a requiredfield validator I just added to one form is preventing all of my other forms from submitting. what 's the rule that I 'm not following?
2800;neutral;you might want to change your accepted answer, as per** user9876* PROPN 's comment below.
2801;neutral;Whether this is a terrible PROPN Experience or not depends upon the type of data collected. I once created an online job application system and most of the questions were long and quite detailed. In our testing, we found people often wanted to enter this in a random order and were quite frustrated when they could n't. However, for a simpler checkout or registration process, particularly where steps depend on earlier steps then validation as you go is definitely preferred.
2802;positive;I know this is an old thread but still, I 'd like to share one more tool which I find extremely helpful and user- friendly: This is an online tool that will get you up and running in no time. It also features a variety of pretty nice layouts out of the box. Here are two for example:
2803;negative;I 'm unable trigger a click on the body tag using PROPN, I 'm using this ... even this fails Any ideas?!
2804;positive;My company has no current plans to move to PROPN, so we have n't tested compatability issues yet. PROPN PROPN has an excellent article on the subject however: These links describe some issues as well:
2805;negative;One of my tables in my PROPN database has a growth rate of two nibbles per nanosecond. I was wondering how many megabytes per day that is and should I be worried? My hard disk is 150 PROPN.
2806;positive;from PROPN is excellent to start with.
2807;positive;here is some code to have a gif( that already have transparency in it) transformed( supposed you want to resize it) in bitmap and then can be showed properly with it 's transparency. Good luck! Gr   goire PROPN
2808;neutral;You would probably be much better off" exporting" the code to where you want to run it, so you do n't have all those .svn folders lying around on your web server.
2809;neutral;If it 's not in the dictionary, probably not.
2810;positive;I 've used PROPN, it 's great for an ex- Lisper! I may do it opposite from you and learn PROPN next.
2811;neutral;
2812;positive;Awesome!!
2813;negative;I lied. The problem is back with a vengeance ... 4009 errors in 229 files. This is ridiculous! PROPN, PROPN PROPN.
2814;positive;Thanks for that- I figured that was probably the best solution. Very good answer too!
2815;negative;PROPN PROPN link is now dead :(
2816;positive;In the absence of tuples, they 're sometimes the cleanest way to do things. I generally hate them, though. F# has some nice syntactical sugar for dealing with them. Rather than making me deal with parameters, it treats them as methods that return tuples instead. The various methods end up returning two element tuples: It 's quite handy, and does n't make me feel dirty.
2817;negative;I am working in PROPN and have a PROPN, PROPN, that implements an interface, PROPN. I have a List of PROPN 's, but I need to pass a list of PROPN 's into a function, but I keep getting casting errors, even when I use PROPN. My code is In both PROPN and Main2 I get PROPN works, but it would be really annoying and inefficient to have to do that everywhere I want to call this function.
2818;neutral;This question appears to be off- topic because it is not about programming. See[ What topics can I ask about here](   in the PROPN PROPN. Perhaps[ Web PROPN PROPN PROPN](   would be a better place to ask.
2819;neutral;How do I exercise an action to ensure it redirects to the correct action or route?
2820;positive;I really like PROPN, and since it 's a PROPN, other PROPN programs use it as the editor, so it 's goodness everywhere!( why is everybody else assuming you use windows?)
2821;positive;Is there anyway to control the styling of the scrollbars of a div tag? I am experiencing some contrast issues between PROPN and PROPN 3.5.2. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
2822;negative;Strings containing XML is an extremely bad idea and asking for trouble. Use messages that have a defined schema. I had to rewrite significant portions of an app that used a lot of XML internally instead of types. It was horribly slow and impossible to figure out what was happening.
2823;negative;Sorry, most of the code for this is 3rd party and I do not have access to it, making things extremely difficult/ frustrating.
2824;neutral;I would like to intercept the event in a .NET PROPN PROPN PROPN when the user has changed tab by double- clicking the tab( instead of just single- clicking it). Do you have any idea of how I can do that?
2825;negative;My company currently use PROPN. PROPN, which I find quite a pain on the neck to configure. What PROPN solution do you use?
2826;positive;Great question! I also find myself a little lost in PROPN because of the amount of flexibility it offers and have been looking for guidance in how to choose fonts, layout, PROPN, colors, etc. I 've had a hard time finding books or websites to improve my PROPN design skills, so I hope we find great answers here!
2827;positive;I really enjoy using PROPN too. I few days ago I realized an PROPN app to get access to your account info on your PROPN, this is the PROPN link: Best! Pablo
2828;positive;Fantastic work! You were correct to choose yours as the accepted answer. Really appreciate you sharing the script with us. :)
2829;positive;Agree that you should ensure that your data is properly indexed. Apart from that, if you are worried about table size, you can always implement some type of data archival strategy to later down the line. Do n't worry too much about this until you see problems cropping up, and do n't optimise prematurely.
2830;neutral;What does this have to do with programming?
2831;negative;that 's not a maintainable solution. most modern code metrics( readability, simplicity, maintainability) would conclude it 's a terrible solution.
2832;neutral;Can fogbugz track case dependencies?
2833;positive;PROPN PROPN has a pretty good blog post about how to do this here: Best of all it is simple and free!
2834;neutral;I 'm not familiar with PROPN specifically, but I 've seen this same problem come up when working with PROPN and other XML- based frameworks. There are generally two solutions: Rethink your page and data architecture so that the entire list written depending on a single condition. This may require a loop inside the s: fragment. Wrap the offending non- valid fragment html in a<![ PROPN[ ...]]>
2835;positive;Excellent and simple.
2836;positive;ya, indeed very good thinking for a teenager!
2837;positive;Reviewing the PROPN docs for the functions listed, I see that the function checks with the PROPN table, which is referenced by a standard It appears that you indeed can find the information you seek through the PROPN. You may have to install a driver to get that information out to your program. Good luck!
2838;positive;Wow!! The question sounds like question for working in the kitchen. I am amazed the names used for the tools :)
2839;negative;Hate to break the bad news, but PROPN() already uses threads internally.
2840;negative;Apart from the books available from, I am looking for some links to any resources that could help in learning the PROPN library. Preferably, with example code and tutorials. PROPN results have not been terribly informative for me. So I am asking here for links to PROPN resources.
2841;positive;thanks for the great tip! I was really thinking of this because this is the only file that change per environment
2842;positive;Almost Everything explained above, hope this too helps! PROPN PROPN       Difference Between CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and PROPN()       CURRENT_TIMESTAMP Equivalent in PROPN PROPN. See this.
2843;neutral;If I use PROPN to create PROPN for my web project do I need to worry about preventing PROPN PROPN PROPN?
2844;positive;I am writing a webPage using asp.net and c#. I want to divide my webpage into 2 columns such as in one I will have buttons that change the view in the other column, without" stepping on" the content of the first column. example: PROPN 1| :) a picture ... button 2| I tried to use divisions but I think I 'm not using them properly. any help would be great! thanks!!!
2845;positive;+1 for the sarcasm!
2846;negative;We use PROPN in our software, and I wish the previous developers did n't do this as we now have to access the hessian endpoint from PROPN. It 's a pain and I prefer things to be in simple PROPN xml or json.
2847;positive;I know I 've mentioned this several times before but PROPN PROPN 's book[ Effective PROPN](   covers these gotchas in a clear way.
2848;positive;ROFL! Upvoted for the hilarious title! :D
2849;neutral;After reading the PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN book and using a number of other design patterns, I 'm trying to understand the PROPN pattern. Is n't this already implemented using Events in the .NET PROPN?
2850;negative;PROPN, PROPN can not be poorly formed. A stipulation of PROPN is that it is well formed and valid. Sorry for the lame comment, invalid PROPN angers me.
2851;positive;( Great question!)
2852;neutral;You will need to use some PROPN queries Here is some code I have used in a previous script( it was taken off the net somewhere, and I 've left in the copyright notices)
2853;negative;PROPN, implicit joins! I want to tear my eyeballs out looking at that.
2854;neutral;When contributing to a very old, and apparently no longer maintained, open- source or public domain project, is it suggested practice to follow the original author 's coding style even if it is terrible? More importantly, are there any reasons why one would want to follow the original author 's coding style rather than clean it up significantly?
2855;negative;I 'm using VS2008, in a normal mid- size solution. Sometimes, debug stepping becomes very slow. A padlock gets rendered on the every file tab for every" step"( PROPN/ PROPN), and it can take up to two seconds for every step. That makes debugging very annoying and slow. Has anyone seen this problem?
2856;positive;Use if- else inside scriplet based on the currently selected language and place appropriate" td" tags. Hope this is what you are looking for!
2857;neutral;PROPN:
2858;negative;Why use a` PROPN` here? The` PROPN` method just returns a reference to an instance( this is a reference type). Whether the object referenced is mutable or immutable is irrelevant. The reference is to the same object no matter if the object mutates. Why do locking? Even if the instance was not" singleton" or" read- only", i.e. even if the field reference could change, since[ reference assignments are atomic](   there would still be no need for PROPN`. I will downvote this answer@ +109 net upvotes ...
2859;positive;I answered the same question. Best of luck! As you will see, I like the tools.
2860;negative;I really fail to see the use case ... If you will type PROPN) what 's so hard( and different) about typing print("foobar") instead? Because even if you were to use this in a function, you 'd get the local name of the variable ... In any case, here 's the in case there 's something you need in there.
2861;neutral;What technologies are you using? You can write direct to PROPN 2007+( .docx) as it 's basically just a zip file with XML in it( in an awful and poorly documented format, but never mind). If you 're using the older binary format then it all depends on which 3rd- party tool you 're using to write to document.
2862;neutral;` PROPN()` paging emulation, or PROPN PROPN 2012 's` OFFSET .. PROPN` clause can be quite slow for high page numbers:    In that case, the[ seek method](   might be a better choice, as it allows for paging in constant time.
2863;positive;that 's a really cool functionality of php i did n't know about! I 'm not exactly sure how I 'd actually_ use_ it, but that 's still cool!
2864;negative;Its absurdly late/ early so maybe I 'm just tired, but can anyone tell me why in the world the following test is not failing? Really need a second pair of eyes to confirm I 'm not crazy ... now I 'm worried that all my tests are unreliable.
2865;neutral;In terms of performance and optimizations: When constructing a table in PROPN PROPN, does it matter what order I put the columns in? Does it matter if my primary key is the first column? When constructing a multi- field index, does it matter if the columns are adjacent? Using PROPN PROPN syntax, is it possible to specify in what position I want to add a column? If not, how can I move a column to a difference position?
2866;neutral;PROPN has c++ PROPN/ PROPN, what 's the issue/ pain?
2867;positive;I have a virtual machine running windows 2003 server running MOSS 2007. This virtual machine is not being run on my dev machine, but on a different machine on the network. I can ping both the host and guest OS from my dev machine. I just need to know, if it is possible, how to configure visual studio 2008 to deploy the web parts/ projects/ etc to the remote VM when I do this: Any input will be greatly appreciated! Thanks.
2868;negative;Lately, bringing the help window from PROPN PROPN is taking a long time. Even updating the help system takes an awful long time. Is there something broken with my installation?
2869;neutral;I 'm using this installation for a non- networked demo of the application, and I 'll only have my laptop there. I toyed with a virtual machine on my laptop, though I 'm afraid the speed would hamper my demo.
2870;neutral;Most of the time I 'd simply add a .txt file to the solution or abuse comments to do it. However, if you use the scratch pad to store todo lists et cetera you can use PROPN: in your comments and visual studio will add them to the built in todo list.
2871;positive;If you handle the PROPN event you can check the value of the data and modify the attributes of the cell or apply a different style in that event handler. That should give you what you are looking for. Let me know if you need it in PROPN rather than C#. Good PROPN!
2872;positive;I 've had great success with 's PROPN- Suggest implementation. It includes PHP examples too.
2873;negative;All but one of the answers you got provide another frightening example of how people can get very basic C syntax wrong.
2874;neutral;I understand that letting any anonymous user upload any sort of file in general can be dangerous, especially if it 's code. However, I have an idea to let users upload custom PROPN scripts to my website. I would provide the template so that the user could compete with other PROPN 's in an online web game I wrote in PROPN. I either need a solution to ensure a user could n't compromise any other files or inject malicious code via their uploaded script or a solution for client- side execution of the game. Any suggestions?( I 'm looking for a solution that will work with my PROPN scripts)
2875;positive;You should look into the PROPN library() as it supports multiple platforms and has bindings for a variety of programming languages. It also supports PROPN. Good luck!
2876;positive;If you need portable PROPN audio library try. It certainly has a mac port. As for mp3 files: it 's certainly doable in" raw" PROPN, only I 'm afraid you 'd have to code everything yourself :). If you can afford some external library I 've found some here.
2877;neutral;Now owned by PROPN at PROPN.
2878;neutral;What are the ways to retrieve data submitted to the web server from a form in the client PROPN in PROPN?
2879;negative;Is there an easy way to find parse errors in javascript code? Last week I was debugging a javascript problem where the first javascript function that was called gave an' object expected' error. I later determined that this was because the browser was n't able to parse my javascript code. I eventually solved the problem but it was a painful process that involved pouring over my code line by line, trying to find my mistake. There must be an easier way.
2880;positive;Hey, I saw that you used asyncsocket to get the desired result. Any chance I could pick your brains about this sometime? I 'm @suprfrends on twitter. It would be PROPN appreciated!
2881;positive;I need some drawings in my tableview. How can i do this. Any help will be greatly appreciated!!
2882;neutral;i have a cache that uses PROPN to the cached objects to make them automatically removed from the cache in case of memory pressure. My problem is that the cached objects are collected very soon after they have been stored in the cache. The cache runs in a 64- Bit application and in spite of the case that more than 4gig of memory are still available, all the cached objects are collected( they usually are stored in the PROPN- heap at that moment). There are no garbage collection induced manually as the process explorer shows. What methods can i apply to make the objects live a litte longer?
2883;positive;That 's funny, this is exactly what I am attempting to figure out the best way to do at the moment. I had thought of using a PROPN, but as I already have a lot of other nested PROPN being used, I was also looking into the State tag. If anyone knows" the right thing" to do I 'll be very interested too!
2884;neutral;So i have design a programming languages and got far enough that i wrote example code and started writing PROPN. I want to know is there a checklist of things i may want to do before writing the rest of my PROPN? what should i do afterward? i am afraid implementation will take a long time( its as complex as and maybe more then PROPN). What are things i should do or things i should consider?
2885;neutral;whatever you do DONT write your own reverse proxy .. it always ends in tears.
2886;neutral;If I were you I 'd tackle it in a slightly different way. Why not add all the data onto your page, but just hide it and only reveal when you want it. That way you do n't have to worry about closures and whatnot.
2887;negative;@Suma How can this be a duplicate if the question you mentioned was posted a year after this one?
2888;positive;ROFL!! I love the comparison to getting married ...
2889;neutral;I 'm trying to get better performance out of this PROPN query( which is terribly slow). I 'm an PROPN beginner so maybe someone can point out a better way to approach this query. I have a table with information on different families. I want to extract the different relationships based on a relationship type. The solution I came up with uses a hash join to query the database ...
2890;negative;The .NET installation is one of the most painful setups of all history, in all means possible. I 've did many such setups and about half of them even* crashed* for PROPN.
2891;negative;Yes, these queries are horrible. Do a regular join instead.
2892;neutral;If you are worried that the overhead of calling functions is slowing you down, why not test inlining the PROPN code or turning it into macros? Also, why not improve the const correctness of the PROPN code while you are at it- const_cast should really be used sparingly, especially on interfaces you control.
2893;positive;An excellent` PROPN` installation appears[ here](   in one of PROPN 's blogs- presumably relating to its use in PROPN.
2894;positive;PROPN drawing!
2895;negative;The PROPN PROPN app looks awful --both the gradients and the unnecessary boxed look imposed by the gray border. PROPN to the standard UITableView look. What PROPN uses for* their* apps is what looks most professional, not random novelty stuff.
2896;positive;If you are moving to a new page in the same browser window, PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN both have excellent answers. If you are opening the eshop link in a new window, there is not much you can do with css alone, and gs has a reasonable answer except for the choice of class name of( red). Which is it?
2897;neutral;I need to specifically catch PROPN server timeout exceptions so that they can be handled differently. I know I could catch the PROPN and then check if the message string Contains" PROPN" but was wondering if there is a better way to do it?
2898;negative;The following( cut down) PROPN excerpt is a PROPN- To- PROPN query that results in PROPN( via PROPN) that is much slower than a hand crafted query. Am I doing anything stupid, or is Linq- to- Entities just bad at optimizing queries? I have a PROPN() at the end of the query as I need to execute it before using it to build an XML data structure( which was a whole other pain). While working on this, I 've also has some real problems with Dates. When I just tried to include returned dates in my data structure, I got internal error" 1005".
2899;negative;Yes, the question mentioned it wo n't work. I was trying to describe why it was n't terribly important to even try to do it that way.
2900;positive;If I am using PROPN 7.0 PROPN PROPN 2008/ PROPN PROPN, any ways from PROPN 7.0 side to control the upload speed? For example, PROPN upload speed at 1 PROPN bytes/ second? Any configuration based easy solution is great! And any programming based solution is also appreciated. :-) thanks in advance, PROPN
2901;negative;My experiences sound similar to yours. I 've only just started using doctrine, and have never used PROPN. However I am very disapointed in PROPN. It 's documentation is terrible. Poorly organised, and quite incomplete.
2902;negative;As title, basically I have a user control placed inside a page and then the page is placed inside the master page. I want to extract a block of javascript and put it back to the page head. When I try to wrap the code inside any block control( e.g. a div runat server) and access PROPN then PROPN PROPN off with I do nt want to extract PROPN inside cs file, that s awfully ugly approach( all sort of escapes and people wo nt even notice you have PROPN written unless they drill your PROPN file), what can I do?
2903;negative;Note that this does n't use a PROPN, so will have horrible performance for very long sequences.
2904;positive;There 's a discussion related to this and one. Essentially, you use PROPN to accomplish it. Best of luck!
2905;negative;I have developed my site with PROPN and PROPN plugin, but when i deploy it to other browsers( PROPN/ PROPN), the console window appears at the bottom of the PROPN annoying). How can i disable this? and why is it appearing? PROPN
2906;neutral;he hates p tags, clearly ;)
2907;neutral;Actually, PROPN is not always slow and it does n't always take all that much code.
2908;positive;Please do have a look at django- rest- framework, I just stepped over from tastypie to this new framework, works great! Especially the class based views and the browsable api! and many other advantages( e PROPN PROPN to upload images)
2909;negative;All the formatting templates in PROPN will put the plus on the next row( which I find really annoying), so you can simply apply the code formatter and the plus will end up on the next row.
2910;neutral;The obvious way to plot a path with virtual earth( PROPN. GetDirections) is limited to 25 points. When trying to plot a vehicle 's journey this is extremely limiting. How can I plot a by- road journey of more than 25 points on a virtual earth map?
2911;positive;Have you tried the and methods? There is a that mentions the approach. Also, in PROPN 4.0 PROPN added the that allows you to get a unique handle on a row. The feature is supported by PROPN and PROPN. For sql server you will probably need a third party driver such as. Good luck!
2912;positive;Just started testing as a PROPN solution for our company. Someone asked for a PROPN map on the page showing our upcoming engagements. I know PROPN provides an API that allows accessing its data from the outside, but I actually need to integrate the map on the data- entry form. If anyone could provide a pointer to any mashup with PROPN PROPN( be it PROPN PROPN, PROPN PROPN, or any similar web service), I would be extremely grateful.
2913;neutral;will a thread sleeping for a long time get killed cleanly when your app is told to exit( if the exit occurs before the time happens)?
2914;positive;I have a string with some markup which looks like this: I 'm trying to strip away everything except the anchor elements with" entry://id=" inside. Thus the desired output from the above example would be: Writing this match, the closest I 've come so far is: But I ca n't figure out why this does n't work. Any help( apart from the" why do n't you use a parser" :) would be greatly appreciated!
2915;negative;that PROPN is PROPN sad PROPN
2916;neutral;It 's usualy known as[ PROPN presentation](
2917;positive;I have an application that is being built using PROPN. It will be running on machines that will have two( or more) network cards. I need the ability for my application to select which ethernet interfaces for a TCP connection. Before anyone suggests it I can not guarenteed that routing tables will be setup correctly. I know how to do this using the windows socket classes but have been unable to find anything about it for PROPN. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
2918;negative;I have a password that I want to store as property in a Web Part that can be set via the tool pain. Currently it is a String and can be clearly read. How would I go about making it* out? If this is the wrong way to be doing this what would you advice to do instead?
2919;positive;Great link! Thanks. I might use this document if we move over to PROPN in our robots.
2920;neutral;If I understand the question, then Resharper calls this' inline method'- PROPN- PROPN+ I
2921;neutral;You could also group the characters by language. Load each language table as needed, and when you need to switch languages, unload the previous language table and load the new one.
2922;neutral;That makes sense, but the issue for me was that I had no way of knowing a PROPN actually became a PROPN.
2923;neutral;" Rendered instantly" sounds way better than" Rendered in less than a second".
2924;negative;PROPN: Which bit? It 's still going to be horribly inefficient for long sequences, as it 's still doing an enormous amount of string concatenation.
2925;positive;Thanks PROPN, that looks to be an excellent document to read, I 'm printing it now.
2926;neutral;I have used in PROPN with great success. However, I am trying to learn PROPN. I have an PROPN bot that I would like to add some features to, mostly having to do with screen scraping web pages from our corporate intranet. That requires being redirected to a corp- wide login page, then going to the destination, then having to possibly submit another login. Does anyone know of something that I can use from PROPN to get this sort of functionality?
2927;negative;This is just syntax sugar over what PROPN wrote. I 'm afraid that this generator could be very slow if grids are sufficiently large. After all, each yield still requires four index lookups.
2928;positive;When using sIFR on the titles( PROPN PROPN) in my WP theme, it somehow messes up the spacing and pushes the title down. The actual flash video is the same size as the font, so I think it has something to do with CSS, though I 've tried just about everything I could think of and ca n't get it lined up properly. Here 's a link to the site: Any help would be absolutely appreciated :) Sean
2929;positive;Excellent method and exactly what I need right now. I wish I could upvote this twice.
2930;neutral;I agree most important is not what style one uses but it being consistent. With that said, the new MS/.NET styling for private fields tends to be_ PROPN( PROPN followed by a camelCased name)
2931;neutral;Do any of you know of a tool that will search for .class files and then display their compiled versions? I know you can look at them individually in a hex editor but I have a lot of class files to look over( something in my giant application is compiling to Java6 for some reason).
2932;negative;I do n't know why the editor is giving me so much trouble. At first the code blocks would n't do anything but indent, so I had to change it to pre tags. Then my carefully numbered sequence is now all 1s. This thing is making me look ridiculous!
2933;positive;The above code sample uses 100% cpu until DONE is true. How can I implement a program that loops and only terminates when DONE, but which does n't use 100% cpu? Modern languages use something like PROPN. ProcessMessages or something like that to give the OS the control for the moment and then return to the loop. I 'm new at PROPN, obviously ... using latest GCC, PROPN and PROPN( a portable solution would be great!)
2934;negative;From my own experience, PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN is a PROPN PROPN- PROPN. It is PROPN FREAKING slow and its PROPN PROPN is just really poor. I had to ask my team to rewrite all the plumbing code of my PROPN PROPN component to get rid of the awful performances of PROPN PROPN.
2935;negative;A( it does n't have to be a class; structs and interfaces can be partial too) is basically a single type which has its code spread across multiple files. The main use for this is to allow a code generator( e.g. a PROPN PROPN designer) to" own" one file, while hand- written code is put in another. I 've no idea whether PROPN/ PROPN have the same capabilities, I 'm afraid.
2936;neutral;Can you show us some code? Extremely difficult to diagnose otherwise.
2937;neutral;I know its possible to convert an image to PROPN using however, this is a chokepoint of my entire program. I need to do this often, on PROPN pixel images and takes about 200- 300ms for this operation to complete, on average. I know I can do this alot faster by using one for loop to loop through the image data and set it right away. The code above on the other hand constructs a brand new PROPN PROPN that is gray scale. I would rather just transform the image I pass in. Does any one know how to do this with a for loop and given that the image is PROPN color space?
2938;positive;Today I saw a demonstration of the PROPN PROPN and it had a few features that I really liked. One was that items in the treview on the left that had no version for the current language was shown in an italic font. It should n't be to hard to implement this into Sitecore, anyone got any ideas? PROPN PROPN
2939;positive;Got it! Thank you all for helping me reach a great" Aha!" moment :-) ... hopefully after I spend some more time in PROPN I 'll understand why this works.
2940;neutral;I 'm not sure that link works anymore.
2941;positive;Amazingly useful- thanks a bunch, PROPN!
2942;neutral;This guy seems to have your answer.
2943;neutral;Another option would be to make sure the PROPN surface is the same size as the client rectangle size(). Then you know you 'll render to the appropriate size and not have to worry at all about the width of PROPN, borders, etc.
2944;neutral;What are you trying to sort? Is there any reason not to use: I 'm sure this uses PROPN and you do n't have to worry about making any coding errors. You can implement IComparable to change what you want to sort on. If all your data does n't fit in memory ... well the you 're off to the races with PROPN sort or something along those lines.
2945;neutral;You 've said" For the sole purpose of reporting". Does this mean that the data is pulled into PROPN from some other system. If so, this would mean the design would not need to worry overly about normalization for update/ integrity purposes.
2946;neutral;They do n't leak, but they will consume resources until they are garbage collected. The PROPN will call PROPN() on them. I do n't think PROPN maintains a connection to the database, so you would n't have to worry about calling PROPN() or PROPN() on it. to a similar question.
2947;neutral;" Most merchants I have worked with were scared to death of exactly that". There are few things scarier to a business than," we 're taking away your ability to get money".
2948;neutral;Because of abuse by spammers, many PROPN egress nodes decline to emit port 25( PROPN) traffic, so you may have problems.
2949;positive;This is a great question .. my approach for solving this question would be to ask: Given a list of items, what is the popability of choosing two consecutive items from the list which are sorted. As the list becomes more sorted, the probability will approach 100%. To calculate this probability is relatively simple: I hope this helps!
2950;neutral;I have ci, so our staging environment builds itself. Should I have a script that not only builds production but does all the branching for it as well? When you have 1 code base on 2 different urls with skinning, should they be required to build at once?
2951;neutral;Since there are two different Open- source libraries( and) to handle writing& extracting files from a zip file, why worry about doing it yourself?
2952;negative;I 'm working on importing data from our application into PROPN PROPN PROPN. It seems simple with the PROPN table, and many resources online, but I do n't seem to understand it. I 'm looking for a simple way to post a transaction of$ X on a specific date, between 2 or more accounts. I 'm terrified of incorrectly posting anything in the PROPN.
2953;neutral;Are you suffering from either of the issues in?
2954;neutral;PROPN:    See Text in yellow box
2955;negative;Probably has something to do with the unbearable bugginess of the PROPN PROPN suite
2956;positive;Good luck!
2957;neutral;I used the same approach as PROPN PROPN. Under load, performance suffers because new NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs need to be allocated for each PROPN/ PROPN. Regardless, in the Enqueue, send args with NotifyCollectionChangedAction. PROPN, the item added, and PROPN as the index. In the Dequeue, send args with NotifyCollectionChangedAction. PROPN, the item removed, and index 0.
2958;positive;I do n't think that it is possible to compare a shelved version with a local version in PROPN PROPN, however I 'll be very happily corrected on the matter.
2959;negative;Ironically years later, I 'm wondering why in the world I wanted to do this. I hate apps that do this.
2960;neutral;Are you worried about" impinging on PROPN 's work" for copyright/ plagiarism reasons?
2961;positive;And on that note, if there is a library out there that does, that will do fine :)
2962;neutral;I know you can have pre and post build events at a project level, but I want to stop and start a service at the beginning and end of a build of the solution -- i.e. when I do a' PROPN PROPN' the service is stopped and the last action of the build is to re- start the service. There are no build events on the solution property page, so what should I do? I 'm guessing that I can add tasks to the msbuild file but I 'm afraid I do n't understand the relationship between PROPN and PROPN at all. Does PROPN execute msbuild with the PROPN file?
2963;neutral;it can not be done through explorer.exe
2964;neutral;Is there a keyboard shortcut or macro to collapse all regions in PROPN PROPN 's toolbox?( Failing either of those, I 'll take an addin that allows this!)
2965;positive;I 'm absolutely staggered by the amazing response I 've received in the last 10 minutes! PROPN all so much for your answers. Very, very helpful.
2966;positive;These are the tables: How would I do to list the last commented thread on top? This is currently how it looks: I ca n't figure this one out folks. So if someone could give me an hand that would be great! Cheers!
2967;neutral;Not really, no. I basically just took PROPN 's word for it that the PROPN would be reasonably stable, used this during testing, and then changed the interface to react to OnMouseMove events instead for the final deployment. I did n't do that originally because it means passing events up through a whole chain of PROPN and is generally just a pain in the ass. It is, however, more reliable than the above method, which only failed once or twice during the whole of testing, but did fail.
2968;negative;I was afraid of that. Poorly formatted code really bothers me. I guess I 'll learn to live with it.
2969;positive;thank you so much as long you replace char(0) with 0 in the above this works great!
2970;neutral;What is the PROPN application using? You can always use the same thing or wrap the timer code from PROPN into a PROPN class.
2971;neutral;I 'm looking for some open source alternative to create reports from classic asp they do n't have to be something awfully elaborated, we rather find some simple product that allows us to generate pdf files from a data set. we were thinking about developing some kind of service that took an xml as input and returned a pdf, probably with jasperreports or any other free tool ... we also looked for a component that could convert plain html to pdf, adding some special tags to handle pagination and layout ... any idea?
2972;neutral;How did u do that on PROPN?
2973;positive;I would recommend 2 things:- Calculate and combine polygons that are touching. This involves a PROPN of processing and hard math, but I 've done it so I know it 's possible.- Create your own overlay instead of using PROPN in PROPN format, while you combine them in the previous suggestion. You 'll have to create a PROPN of PROPN but it is blazing fast on the client. Good luck :)
2974;negative;Tried this. Failed miserably. See
2975;negative;Did you ever figure this out? I 've had to post a dupe because I ca nt:
2976;negative;I am crying on the inside. And on the outside.
2977;neutral;At this time, I 'm doing this: dateSelected value look this: PROPN PROPN 11 2009 00:00:00 PROPN( PROPN PROPN PROPN) 2 PROPN: a) Is it possible to use this in .NET directly( string to PROPN)? b) I tried several way to return PROPN/ mm/ yyyy without success PROPN,
2978;neutral;You can also right click the method name and click" Find all References" in PROPN PROPN. I personally would just do a PROPN+ PROPN+ H to
2979;positive;It proved the point. They are very excited about SO now.
2980;negative;I find it comes back periodically. What 's most frustrating about it is that everytime it does come back, it breaks PROPN as the account under which that runs does not have access to delete the aspnet_client folder created!
2981;neutral;I have included it as written, but when dragging controls from the PROPN, they still get a" green line" below the ajaxtoolkit tag- and the intellisense does not popup as expected ... is there anything else needed?
2982;neutral;Say I have a PROPN table( PROPN is PROPN) and a sales table, where the sales table has a PROPN column for PROPN. Now when designing my deleteEmployee stored procedure, should I first delete rows in the Sales table or should I create seperate stored procedures to delete in each table, and then worry about that in my business logic layer?
2983;negative;Hate to say it, but how about just testing it?
2984;negative;Nearly everything coming out of PROPN draws their menus differently then plain PROPN menus. It really annoys me that this never makes into the PROPN. OS- level PROPN menus are so far out of date that drawing them yourself is nearly a requirement these days.
2985;neutral;Is it possible you have an older version lying around in your bin folder? Another alternative is that some other code is comipled against the older version. If all else fails you can use to force your new version.
2986;neutral;I 've got a couple of models. Neither have any list view other than their admin entries. For that reason, it 's a bit of a pain to manually work out the PROPN for model instances. I would like to show a link on the listing and detail PROPN views that takes me directly to the public view. I can do the nonsense that works creates the URL but I do n't know how to get it to show in the admin. Any ideas?
2987;positive;This project looks very promising- thanks!
2988;neutral;Do you happen to know why PROPN doubly nests the actual` PROPN` statement? Is( was?) that a subtle performance tweak for some PROPN PROPN version? I feel that the 2nd level could be merged with the 1st level.
2989;positive;Before you go that route, have you seen this: It 's a series of articles about writing Effects( supported in .NET PROPN) as fragment shaders that run on your PROPN ... Pretty neat stuff!
2990;negative;I 'm just going through the same process! I was looking at this page:    which starts talking about coffee shops! At that point I gave up. You 've got to love PROPN/ oracle documentation!
2991;neutral;Question explicitly states PROPN
2992;negative;I think I 've been using these terms interchangably/ wrongly!
2993;positive;Thank you for all the great answers! PROPN& PROPN 's answers accomplished this most simply using PROPN. Thx again!
2994;neutral;Also, if you are worried about trips to the PROPN, make steps into a stored procedure. Then you have one trip.
2995;positive;I 've got a php array: I want to pass this array via PROPN PROPN, with this: And here 's my PROPN: How can I pass the array, so that with the" replyMessage.php" page, I could take each PROPN from the PROPN, to do something like this: Any help is greatly appreciated!
2996;negative;There 's some debate over that PROPN entry. Yes, by all means, answer your own question. But if you routinely have a set of pre- baked questions and answers, then this site just becomes a blog, rather than an exchange. You have the misfortune of picking a day when someone abused the spirit of that PROPN.
2997;negative;or a working PROPN example. With so many classes it 's a pain to figure out what calls what
2998;positive;I am making an isometric game on the PROPN, and need a little help. What is the best way to go about calculating the path a object must take if it is thrown from one tile to another? I 've been looking into using NSBezierPaths, but ca n't quite work out how to use them for the objects path? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
2999;neutral;How to add some text between content tags. Say Wow it works!
3000;neutral;Could someone tell me what the units the SetTimeout(int) method in the PROPN interface uses? Is it milliseconds, seconds, minutes or other?
3001;positive;I loved the visualization of the race. Well done.
3002;negative;This is sad, I told you how to handle raw packets, and I only got 3 votes, while the accepted answer has 8 votes and basically did n't answer the question ...
3003;neutral;This seems to work.
3004;neutral;is limited to an accuracy of 55 milliseconds ...
3005;positive;" Software developers are always optimists -- just look at their estimating skils!"- Love it!!
3006;neutral;Is there some official documentation on it?
3007;positive;I have exactly the same issue and am extremely interested in whether you found any solution.
3008;negative;Yup many hours later I found that a single panel that was wrapped around the section had a EnableViewState="false" added to it. Sad part is that I know I did n't add that because I did n't even know what it was until PROPN here mentioned it. PROPN PROPN must have added it sometime.
3009;positive;i am writing a flash app that receives its data over a XMLSocket. On the testmachine that worked really fine, but now the data will be ssl secured. Is there any XMLSSLSocket or something similar available? If not XMLSocket a normal SSLSocket would be a great help as well.
3010;positive;I 'm trying to write a batch process that can take an MP3 file and mute certain parts of it, ideally in PROPN or PROPN. Take this example: Given a 2 minute MP3, I want to mute the time between 1:20 and 1:30. When saved back to a file, the rest of the MP3 will play normally -- only that portion will be silent. Any advice for setting this up in a way that 's easy to automate/ run on the command line would be fantastic!
3011;negative;I have an asp: Menu control that has four different menu items in it. Each menu item has a graphic and a text description. My problem is the icon and text have no padding between them and it just looks ugly! Does anyone know how I can force a bit of padding between the image and text of the menu item? I 've looked at all of the attributes on the asp: Menu control, but I have n't been able to find one for this, but I may have just missed it.
3012;neutral;Perhaps you could deserialise the byte array using a known encoding and ensure that( a) it does n't throw any exceptions, and( b) deserialises to the original string. It seems that from your description of the scenario, you may not have the original string readily available. Might there be a way to create it?
3013;neutral;I 've updated my post to contain sample PROPN/ PROPN code
3014;negative;You should be able to add the attribute during OnPreRender(). PROPN is so painful sometimes ...
3015;positive;Try<% if(ViewContext. PROPN==" PROPN> Should work fine!!! PROPN: PROPN IN PROPN Removed the PROPN property from the PROPN class.
3016;neutral;Using PROPN is great( i use it too) but i would suggest using a" packager" like pyinstaller( my personal fav, alternatives bb_freeze, PROPN) to create an exe before the using PROPN The primary benefit you get by doing this is; Your download is smaller as you 're not bundling the whole PROPN PROPN PROPN and extra stuff your app wo nt need and you get an exe file to boot!
3017;neutral;If you are not completely allergic to PROPN, then comes with a tool named that can split a document, producing well- formed XML section. You can split on a level of the tree, by size or on an PROPN expression.
3018;neutral;It is actually spelled" PROPN"
3019;neutral;Is there a way to call out from a TSQL stored procedure or function to a webservice?
3020;negative;Yup, wcf is a world of PROPN PROPN, stick to asmx
3021;positive;This is better than mine. Did n't know you could do a string array for formats. Very nice!
3022;positive;The following scripting is a custom addition to this PROPN PROPN PROPN; in my version it keeps the text of the button while changing the background images through css classes only. I have able to everything except when you click on another button you get two active buttons and so on. I like the buttons to hover{ PROPN class}, click{ span.active class}, and remove any other buttons with the span.active class and put back to regular state. Greatly appreciate a solution!
3023;positive;+1 for the docbkx PROPN plugin, it provides everything needed to work with PROPN in a platform independent manner. It 's an excellent tool even if you are not working on PROPN projects.
3024;positive;I agree with PROPN. PROPN is an excellent choice. It supports audio and video devices It compiles on windows, linux, and a few others Also- I recommend using the PROPN protocol( as opposed to PROPN)- You do n't need to use PROPN. PROPN is a front- end to PROPN. You can take a look at the OPAL samples, and build up from those.
3025;negative;You 're looking for an equivalent of and I 'm afraid it does n't exist explicitely in the PROPN. Go for PROPN 's answer if it is correct for your PROPN implementation.
3026;neutral;I also have a PROPN PROPN here, in VB.NET
3027;positive;Sounds like you are looking for a PROPN tool or similar. There are many tools which you can purchase, but there are also some online tools you can use: Good Luck!
3028;negative;The screen which shows whenever i start PROPN is very annoying, and among the hundreds of options I ca n't find the one which turns it off?
3029;neutral;A related question: Have you faced the issue of making the same code work with 2005 and 2008. If yes, how did you solve it?
3030;neutral;I know how to query workitems, although I have n't been very successful finding info on the PROPN. There 's one basic example that seems to get repeated everywhere. I 'd like to be able to query changesets. Can I do it with PROPN, PROPN, or ..?
3031;negative;PROPN??? Why not just PROPN PROPN 's answer as PROPN instead of copying it over and marking your own answer? Stealing is bad, PROPN?!
3032;positive;PROPN I create a new PROPN handle in PROPN via PROPN, it creates an end effector named" effector1", or" effector2", depending on what is in my scene. I do n't want to rely on the auto- name of the end effector, so I 'm wondering if there is a way to either: a) name the effector at the create- time of the PROPN handle, or b) select the effector for a particular PROPN handle in PROPN. Any help would be greatly appreciated -- thanks!
3033;neutral;PROPN: Depends on how it is used. A common view is that any markup( HTML or otherwise) embedded in code is a horrible idea( see PROPN PROPN 's book on that)
3034;negative;Is there a PROPN equivalent to the PROPN/ PROPN' continue' keyword? In PROPN/ PROPN, the command' continue' starts the next iteration of the loop. Of course, other equivalents exist. I could put the remaining code of the loop in an if- statement. Alternatively, I could use a goto.( PROPN!)
3035;neutral;If I use a nvarchar(n) column as a clustered index on a PROPN PROPN database, am I going to suffer a significant performance hit compared to a numeric( int) index? Also how does the performance of compound indexes compare?
3036;neutral;I 'm looking for experiences with deploying PROPN reports( the basic version, bundled with VS2008) into a production environment. Are there any restrictions? Does it limit the number of concurrent users? Other than downloading and installing the CRRedist2008_x86.msi on the production server, anything to worry about?( And judging from the comments here and other places, yes it would be better to find another solution, but unless there 's something free that works with PROPN/ PROPN, we 're stuck with it for now).
3037;negative;Its not One is it? I have a method that gets five Lists from different repositories. Each call opens and closes a new PROPN. Is this ok to do or should I wrap everything in One datacontext. In this case it is not straightforward to use the same datacontext, but i am afraid that opening and closing numerous datacontext in one page request is not good.
3038;positive;PROPN, those are great news! I am looking forward to try out PROPN!
3039;negative;Crashes for me on a virtual machine without PROPN loaded. I hate annoying PROPN embeds as much as the next guy, but       using it is BAD     might be overegging it slightly ...
3040;negative;PROPN, if your test needs so much setup that you need a' helper' class, you 're going to have pain and friction down the line.
3041;neutral;What I need to know is if adding custom classes and properties to the PROPN metabase schema will cause any running app pools to restart or sessions to be killed off?
3042;neutral;The question was" how important". Answer: it is NOT important at all. If you do n't have a dozen servers running this app already, then this is probably early optimization, and as we all know, early optimization is the root of all evil. In other words: do n't even worry about it. There are a lot of other things to optimize speed before you should even consider this.
3043;neutral;Does n't this just tell me the maximum number of connections that I will allow on the database, not the maximum that it has achieved???
3044;positive;examples of input and output would be extremely helpful here.
3045;negative;I am trying to search my bash history similarly as with PROPN- r, but to forward direction. It has been a pain for me, when I just hit once too often PROPN- r, to find the previous command again. How can you forward search your PROPN history similarly as in reverse searching?
3046;neutral;I have two different asp.net web applications both referencing the same dll e.g.. I want to know if there is a way of adding some web.config setting to one of the application 's config files to avoid the need to have two copies of the dll lying around. My[ simplified] directory structure is as follows:
3047;neutral;The PROPN example" works" in PROPN PROPN in the sense that the background is transparent. However, in PROPN PROPN and PROPN PROPN you must click the play button twice to see the animation.
3048;negative;talks about consuming PROPN services in PROPN, but claims: There will be no proxies, no generated code, no 3rd party utilities, and no disgusting" PROPN PROPN PROPN" usage. What is so wrong with me adding a service reference in my PROPN project? Are there hidden overheads? Or is it a case of Fear Of PROPN PROPN on the part of the author?
3049;positive;Hey, you guys are great, thanks a whole bunch! I will set up the environment in the cron script.
3050;neutral;possible duplicate of[ Is there an equivilent of C# PROPN PROPN in PROPN?](
3051;neutral;The first statement seems to pull back everything from the PROPN and then the second statement gets a subset. What if you just want a subset in the first place? I have 90,000 rows and just want page 4 of 10 rows.
3052;positive;PROPN is a fascinating platform to develop our next generation applications on! The ability to style just about anything, the databinding support and attached/ dependency properties. Wow! But let 's not throw caution to the wind because while WPF performance is great, it 's not the best ... yet. Definitely is a strong contender, but as developers we are still left with design principles for our front ends.
3053;positive;pr0n for sure :)))))))( kidding PROPN)
3054;neutral;How do I use PROPN PROPN to connect to an PROPN database? Currently I just use an PROPN PROPN and PROPN however a requirement is to give the user on install the option of selecting PROPN PROPN since we offer the same as PROPN.
3055;neutral;As a tip: Sorting the whole mess can be very annoying if you had another class structure before. Use PROPN, which can do it automatically.
3056;neutral;I know I can programatically make the taskbar item for a particular window start flashing when something changes, but is there any way I can stop it from flashing either programatically after a certain period of time or at least is there a keyboard shortcur I can give to my users to somehow stop the flashing?
3057;positive;You ... are ... awesome!!!
3058;neutral;I 've been looking at the project as well, which handles PROPN/ PROPN/ PROPN. I do n't know of a single library that handles audio and video files, so you might have to use a few.
3059;positive;I got 2 update panels in one page. After a request I want to check which update PROPN) got updated. I 've read should be good for this :) However, whenever I get a postback in a non- IE browser, the PROPN just returns null? It works very fine in PROPN ... Here 's a codesnippet: I got 2 updatepanels, both with conditional updatemodes: and Any help would be highly appreciated, and I 'm open for alternative solutions which does n't involve Thanks in advance :)
3060;positive;I have two namespaces: 1) Foo. Bar 2) Another. Foo. Bar From a class in namespace 2, how do I reference a class in namespace 1? Using PROPN. Bar leaves you in namespace 2 still ... I hope this is reasonably clear! Thanks.
3061;neutral;PROPN only gives us PROPN syntax on .NET 2.0. We still need an PROPN.
3062;negative;Sorry, I 'll clarify my answer as to what I mean by desktop PROPN. Is the issue here that you want to impose limits, or you 're afraid you 'll exceed them? Or just checking whether there are any?
3063;neutral;Yes, your PROPN configuration has correctly got turned off, because that 's incredibly insecure. Just put: at the top of your script. You can also use if you specifically only want this to work for the PROPN method. I 've seen some people claim that is somehow insecure, but no evidence to back that up.
3064;positive;There is a plugin for PROPN to help you with that. Hope that helps!
3065;neutral;Also, it is worth including( in some fashion) the PROPN PROPN downloads as well. In fact, depending on how your executables are built, you might be forced to install the PROPN and the PROPN PROPN.
3066;positive;Your PROPN method is great! Literally saved me today.
3067;neutral;I 'm pretty sure you want a datetime or timestamp column in that table, too: I ca n't imagine a variant of the app you describe where it would be irrelevant WHEN a status update was posted!
3068;negative;Yes, there are, I 'm afraid
3069;neutral;We 're using PROPN and we 're having problems when we switch branches, it 's throwing up problems with the PROPN bindings every single time. We still have .vspcc files .vsscc files which is I 'm guessing where it stores the bindings, does anyone have any advice on how to easily switch between branches in PROPN without pain?
3070;positive;I have a small PROPN application that hosts a RichTextBox: As shown the code snippet above, I set the font size to 14. If I copy text from this RichTextBox to PROPN PROPN or PROPN PROPN, the font size is reported to be 10.5. Similar oddities persist if I paste text from PROPN or PROPN. I have verified that the text being selected from my app is sized at 14. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
3071;neutral;I have a bunch of .NET frameworks installed on my machine. I know that with the PROPN PROPN, I can use the 6.0 version to target 5.0 and earlier. Can I do something similar with the .NET framework- target 1.0 and 2.0 with the 3.0 framework?
3072;neutral;That is why I said" depending" and" may be able to". There are many options within autohotkey including automating a search, I just gave one example.
3073;negative;The problem is that" Hello World" is a terrible example to use with PROPN. You really need something that generates variable output based on variable input.
3074;neutral;see PROPN PROPN 's suggestion to psuedo- inline that into an extension method.
3075;positive;Not only that, but as the software ages they feel the need to upgrade simply because they know, every time they reference it, that they 're using PROPN 1997, for example. Great for upgrade encouragement! Although even better is a message on the splash screen," Version 2008 is available now!"
3076;positive;Thanks to the two of you that answered. What I ended up doing( in case anyone else is interested!) was processing the openid login like normal, but NOT saving the new user to the database. Instead, I stored their information in a session var and asked them for the remaining information before adding them to the PROPN and logging them in. Hope this helps!
3077;neutral;How about an extension method that calls the actual() implementation? The only downside is you have to add. This works because the parameter( via) infers a type for. As an alternative( if the is a pain), consider making it static, with an instance argument that is used primarily for type inference:

3084;negative;The minute you start down the road to control memory is the minute you start making a mistake. If you have REQUIREMENTS for memory, do n't use .NET. If you do n't have requirements, stop worrying about memory. .NET manages memory better than you ever could. Stop it. Leave it alone. No. Bad. Stop.
3085;positive;I agree. Excellent update. +1.
3086;neutral;Is` PROPN` also expanded into boolean clauses?( Or is it implemented differently somehow?)
3087;neutral;Try but short answer is
3088;neutral;Because PROPN is intent on making development painful ;)
3089;positive;Great! I 'm glad you like it.
3090;neutral;From the documentation at and, I think this should work: Try that and see if it works. Otherwise, I 'm afraid, it 's preg_replace- land.
3091;positive;Awesome, that did it! Thanks PROPN!
3092;negative;PROPN that 's ugly! PROPN wrote that should be flogged.
3093;positive;PROPN PROPN wrote an excellent article for A PROPN PROPN titled PROPN fieldset, legend, label. Highly semantic.
3094;neutral;Using a unique identifiers would allow you to merge data from two different databases. Maybe you have an application that collects data in multiple database and then" syncs" with a master database at various times in the day. You would n't have to worry about primary key collisions in this scenario. Or, possibly, you might want to know what a record 's PROPN will be before you actually create it.
3095;positive;Yes- that feature is extremely useful for writing upgrade scripts.
3096;positive;Yeah, I did n't know about the non- greedy thing either! Is there a site that explains each modifier?
3097;neutral;Another very fast approach is the[ seek method](   which allows to paginate in constant time( maybe even faster than 78ms)
