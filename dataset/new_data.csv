103|"> The github issue tracker is not really the place for questions.  I disagree. The primary problem with pushing questions away from GitHub issues is there is not a clear line between ""questions"" and ""bugs"". For example, a user experiencing a problem might have simply misconfigured something on their local system, but just as easily could have found a bug that affects many people. Alternately, a bunch of repeated questions (duplicates) likely indicates a problem in the user documentation should should be addressed. GitHub issues is the place where people who are interested in participating in the project should feel comfortable participating, and never be dismissed based on something like the ""kind"" of issue they reported."|1

129|"for me, removing the whole ""files"" section altogether seems to cause the errors to go away, indicating that ES6 applies to the entire project.  Not sure if that helps your situation.  The filesGlob wasn't actually the fix.  (FYI, I got the filesGlob idea from tsconfig.json which is a superset of jsconfig.json, and it seemed to fix the issue, as simply removing the 'files' section fixes it for me... but then you're stuck with ES6 for your whole project)"|0

136|If you were on the insiders program and were using the Auto update feature, download the app and replace in Applications and launch.

331|Not particularly easily.

I don't know whether I have the skills to do that or not, I didn't set the project up originally.  Do you think there _should_ be red and green highlighting in the debug console if I run Mocha tests?|-1

338|"Ah. What's changed is that now it it runs the program in an internal console that DOESN'T have highlighting whereas previously it used an external console window.  The external console highlighted things red and green as presumably mocha generates ANSI control characters to configure the colours.  So you appear to have added ""externalConsole"" to the launch configuration, but the default appears to be false if the value isn't specified in the configuration, so it runs it in the Debug Console instead. That's what's changed.  So the request is that the Debug Console honour the ANSI control chars, and that the default appears wrong, from an upgrade migration point of view."|0
339|This is a bad regression. The text box should automatically adjust its height based on its contents. Thanks for the report and extra info!|1
340|The detection currently works only for file paths and not for http links. But we can beef it up I think. However, if we move the repl to an editor, we would benefit from automatic link detection imho.|0

345|"@isidorn yes, our internal debug console supports basic ansi colours but it is not a real ""tty"". Some programs (IIRC mocha is one of them) check explicitly whether they are running in a ""tty"" and only then use colours."|0

363|Sorry, maybe I didn't describe very well. I have extrernalConsole:false, or unspecified, and when I then run, the Debug Console always gets created to the side. There seems to be no way to have it just bring to the front the already existing Debug Console that might exist. So if I Ctrl-Tab, Debug Console is in the list of open windows. Yet when I run, rather than just swapping to that, it brings it up to the side, which I find annoying.|-1
364|We always have one instance of the debug console, and when you launch we will not open a new one but use the one already there. What I think is the cause of confusion is that on each debug start we clear the contents of the console|0
365|But it doesn't reuse the one that's there, or at least if it does, it always moves it and splits the screen and puts the Debug Console on the right. _Thats_ what I fine annoying. The splitting of the screen.|-1

374|I just created a new folder, opened VSCode, clicked on the debug icon, then by the launch dropdown clicked on the great icon. It generated me a new launch.json. I then authored app.js with  console.log(hello world). Click on the launch, it opens the DEbug Console to the right.  So then close the Debug Console so I only have my app.js showing. Shift tab though and the Debug Console is still in the list and I can cycle through to it. However if I run the app.js again, with the app.js showing, then the Debug Console pops up again on the right, rather than just dong the equivalent of Ctrl-tab and cycling through to the file.  I personally find this behaviour annoying, as neither the source window nor the debug console window are then wide enough to see all I need to see (I have a widescreen monitor).|-1

394|@DerTolleEmil So, I don't have any non standard plugins either. Though, when I opened task manager and killed the process thread that was running as a part of code (not the app) that is using 30+% CPU it terminates intellisense I think, because it's no longer working after that point.|0

409|#52 seems to indicate this problem is with all interpolation strings, even beyond ES6 JS. It's good to have a solid version number when this did work, though. Should help tracking it down.|0
410|"@blackwire One more thing regarding auto-update: Edit your `%appdata%\code\storage.json` file and change `""updateChannel"": ""stable""` to `""updateChannel"": ""none""`. That will disable automatic updates."|0

415|I fixed this by hiding the one when the other is present. It is not the same as stacking errors but I think we can try with this approach and see how far we get.|0
416|@matthewjohnston4  I'm not, my files are all saved locally without anything else touching them.|0
417|@DerTolleEmil I work primarily in PHP and yes, the issue does seem to arise while I'm working in a PHP file. Also, thank you very much for the update trick! This is great. I'll wait for issues to be resolved with the new version. I really like some of the features, but I need it to be stable before I can take it. Sad too because I was excited to see the themes were working properly. I'll be patient. Again, you've saved my bacon. I'll be able to get some things accomplished today.|1
418|@weinand not sure if that's the reason, but I'm trying to debug mocha tests in VSCode.  My current workaround is to type `debugger;` in the place I would have a breakpoint, and then, add more breakpoints when the debugger gets caught.  I don't think it's a problem with the sourcemaps, because when I use the `debugger;` statement, I can debug the `.ts` files smoothly.  To reproduce the behavior I'm mentioning, you can follow the steps: - Clone my repo (https://github.com/buzinas/tslint-eslint-rules) - Run `npm install` and then `npm test` - You'll see the `launch.json` configuration. You'll be able to debug TypeScript if:   - You place a breakpoint in the equivalent JS file; or   - You put a `debugger;` where you want to break;  If you put a debugger, then you must run `gulp build` (or ctrl+shift+b).|0
419|Actually this will work as long as the file is under the working files section. Once the file is not, closing it will also make the mode decision lost.|0
420|The `php.validate.executablePath` does not have to be set if php.exe is located in a directory which is listed in your %PATH% variable. If that's not the case you need to set it manually like mentioned above.|0
421|"My simplest repro is:  **sample.ts**  ``` ts async function main() {   await Promise.resolve(1); // bp on this line   console.log(""later""); } main(); ```  Compiled with:  ``` tsc sample.ts --sourceMap --target ES6 --module commonjs ```"|0

424|"Okay I found out that class, super and extends are interpreted as 'invalid.illegal' - why are those interpreted that way? My jsconfig.json contains compiler options for ES6...  ""compilerOptions"": {     ""target"": ""ES6"", }"|0
426|So I fixed the problem.  Installing the Windows 10 November update was the solution.  However, I also tried installing on an existing VM that does not have the November update installed so I'll leave it up to the MS folks to leave this issue open or close it.|0
427|+1. Also `=>`  needs to be in a separate syntax class from the operators that are keywords, such as `instanceof` because I want to color keywords separately from  `=>`. Also for `import * as 'foo'` `import` and `as` need to be keywords while `*` needs to be either an operator or something else more specific to imports.|1
428|This has nothing to do with the tree. You set `tooltip=` and let Electron render the tooltip for you. It's just how tooltips look in your Linux distribution.|0
429|"@buzinas thanks for providing steps that helped me investigating the problem. The problem was the value of ""outDir"": it should be the path to the **generated code** not the source. So after changing it to ""dist"" setting breakpoints in *.ts files worked for me."|1
430|@rbuckton yes, changing the default from Bias.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND to Bias.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND seems to solve the problem. I will test this a little more and then push a fix. Thanks.|1

436|@weinand whoa, what a silly mistake hehe Thanks very much, this will improve my productivity a lot!  A little off topic here, only a question: - WIll there be conditional breakpoints available anytime soon?|1
437|I think that's the correct behavior, since we can import only a set of features, or even name them (giving alias etc). But you could probably write an extension for making this behavior available automatically.|0

439|I am probably screwed, since I percieve the VS Code's font blurry even in the `default` state, aren't I? Will this be fixed? **The font is just not sharp enough.** :/|-1

445|@hashhar we currently do not persist any UI state when you dont open a folder. So you should be able to easily reproduce this by opening Code empty, open a file in it, close and reopen and it will be empty again.|0
446|I was able to reproduce it. And you are right, opening a workspace didn't face this issue. So, is there going to be a fix for this? Because I find this a normal scenario.

I know Linux users who don't know what a .desktop file is, of course they won't be using this tool, but as a provider of a tool aren't you placing yourself as a distributor of a full fledged application rather than give complete app for Mac and Windows and leave Linux to the mercy of the person who'll package the distribution? The basic premise that vscode is now open source states that it should be painless to use in platforms other than Windows, which isn't the case with Linux, you have to add things to the PATH variable and create the .desktop file just to get it running, it is rather annoying to do that, as an end user, _despite being a nerd who is still coding at 1am after working for 12hours_, I'd really love to have a packaged version of vsc|-1

555|I just got the same issue. in the previous version (0.9.1), when I was writing Python scripts, the word completion works fine, though it is textual. But now the functionality is gone. I tried to reinstall it, but nothing changed. Hope can recover this function soon. Thanks:)|0

568|@tangshi @ojss The old version (plus how to disable the auto update) can be found in issue #160, comment https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/160#issuecomment-158093149|0

571|@mattn There's a bit of flakiness with our current builds, they seem to fail occasionally, unrelated to your changes. Will address it **fast**.|1
572|yes. this would be really important since we are already pushing updates to addins.|0
573|Will probably not remove the icon. Pinging the repo every 5-10 seconds is wrong though. There might be something we're doing wrong. Just to confirm: you have the file explorer open and that blue thing keeps on coming and going?|0

578|VSCode's lib dependencies are exactly the same as [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron)'s. That would be the best project to report this to.|0

581|Yes I acknowledge the bug, happened because of a change in our task framework.|0
582|"I see that your scenario would not require the workspace, however our vscode frontend has to support multiple languages to debug and for most having a workspace is required. Also debugging requires a launch.json file, and when there is no workspace there needs to be a shared launch.json which is a bit cumbersome.

Due to the above this is by design."|-1
583|This might not be a dupe after all, thanks @iamzhout!|1
584|So keep it as an open issue in case someone wants to code up a solution? Or is it something that we don't want to have at all because it would make the product worse?|0

588|@joaomoreno  Welcome, hope this issue could be fixed soon :-) otherwise many corporate users may not be able to install extensions and make full use of vscode.|0

591|@Mr21 Very sorry about not communicating this properly, loader.js is a generated file from a TypeScript file that is not yet made public (a different repo). I need to create the public repo that contains it.  Will ping you as soon as I get that done.|-1
592|Indeed, I think the status bar should reflect the cursor state, regardless of the reason the cursor changed its state. So the fix should be made in editorStatus|0
593|@punker76 I did some changes to load the settings and landed this again (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/e57d6db414ee2f3f4e7da0535b39c6b4c1c02817).|0

600|From [docs](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/29052b04986daf55ecda4163bb94adaf522d1a10/docs/tutorial/supported-platforms.md)  > The prebuilt ia32(i686) and x64(amd64) binaries of Electron are built on Ubuntu 12.04, the arm binary is built against ARM v7 with hard-float ABI and NEON for Debian Wheezy.   > Whether the prebuilt binary can run on a distribution depends on whether the distribution includes the libraries that Electron is linked to on the building platform, so only Ubuntu 12.04 is guaranteed to work, but following platforms are also verified to be able to run the prebuilt binaries of Electron: >  >    Ubuntu 12.04 and later  >    Fedora 21  >    Debian 8   Will return to this issue a bit later.|0
